# Quickstart: Modern To-Do List App

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

To run the end-to-end tests, use:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized production assets.
