# Research: Modern To-Do List App

## Summary

The technology stack for this project was provided upfront, and the choices are well-aligned with the project's goals of being minimal, fast, and maintainable. No further research is required.

## Decisions

-   **Frontend Build**: Vite
    -   **Rationale**: Fast development server, optimized builds, and simple configuration.
-   **Language**: TypeScript
    -   **Rationale**: Type safety improves code quality and maintainability.
-   **UI**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript
    -   **Rationale**: Avoids heavy frameworks, ensuring a lightweight and fast application.
-   **State Management**: Simple reactive store
    -   **Rationale**: A full-fledged state management library is overkill for this project.
-   **Persistence**: LocalStorage (abstracted)
    -   **Rationale**: Simple and sufficient for local-first storage, with an abstraction for future replacement.
-   **Testing**: Vitest and Playwright
    -   **Rationale**: Modern and fast testing tools that integrate well with Vite.
