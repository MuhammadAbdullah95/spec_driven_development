# Specification Quality Checklist: Modern To-Do List App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all functional requirements for task management (add, edit, complete, delete, reorder) explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are requirements for data persistence (localStorage) clearly specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements for filtering tasks (All, Active, Completed) fully documented? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are requirements for theme switching (dark/light mode, auto-detection, manual override) complete? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are all specified keyboard shortcuts (selection, reordering) defined with expected behavior? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are requirements for empty states and user feedback messages clearly outlined? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are requirements for future integration (subtasks, SQLite, cloud sync) sufficiently detailed for planning future phases? [Completeness, Spec §Planned (Next Phase / Roadmap Features)]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 - Is "responsive" quantified with specific breakpoint requirements or scaling behavior? [Clarity, Spec §Summary]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is "minimal" defined with measurable criteria for UI elements or visual complexity? [Clarity, Spec §Summary]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is "efficient" quantified with specific interaction times or steps for core actions? [Clarity, Spec §Summary]
- [ ] CHK011 - Is "reasonable character limit" for task titles explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK012 - Is "visually distinct" for completed tasks defined with specific styling rules? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK013 - Is the condition for "confirmation only required if the user has more than 5 tasks" for deletion clearly specified? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK014 - Are persistence requirements consistent between `localStorage` abstraction and future SQLite layer? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK015 - Do keyboard shortcut requirements align with accessibility guidelines? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 - Are performance goals (e.g., "load under 1s", "responsive for 1000+ tasks") objectively measurable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK017 - Is "95% of users can successfully add a new task" measurable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK018 - Is "Lighthouse accessibility score of 90 or higher" a verifiable acceptance criterion? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK019 - Is "No data loss reported by users over a 30-day period" a practical and measurable success criterion? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 - Are requirements defined for all primary user flows (add, edit, complete, delete, reorder, filter, theme)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK021 - Are requirements for keyboard-only interaction scenarios fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK022 - Is the behavior for "very long task title" explicitly defined (e.g., truncation, error message)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 - Is the behavior for "storage being full or unavailable" clearly specified? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 - Is the interaction between "reorder tasks" and "active filters" explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK025 - Are specific security and privacy requirements (e.g., data encryption, user consent) documented beyond "No remote APIs"? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK026 - Are maintainability requirements (e.g., code structure, TypeScript usage) clearly defined? [Completeness, Spec §Maintainability]
- [ ] CHK027 - Are scalability requirements (e.g., for subtasks, sync functionality) sufficiently detailed for future phases? [Completeness, Spec §Scalability]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK028 - Are all external dependencies (e.g., browser APIs, `localStorage`) explicitly listed and their usage defined? [Completeness, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK029 - Is the assumption of "single-user, local-first" explicitly stated and its implications documented? [Clarity, Plan §Scale/Scope]
