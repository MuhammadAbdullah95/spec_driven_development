**Feature Branch**: `002-a-modern-minimal`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A modern, minimal, and responsive To-Do List App that allows users to create, organize, and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app should feel lightweight, start instantly, and store data locally. It should also be designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of subtasks and sync functionality later..."

## Summary

This specification outlines a modern, minimal, and responsive To-Do List App. "Minimal" is defined by focusing on essential task management features and avoiding unnecessary UI elements or complexity. Responsiveness will be achieved through a mobile-first design approach, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The app will feel lightweight, start instantly, and store data locally. "Efficient" means users can capture and manage tasks quickly, with core actions (add, edit, complete) taking less than 2 seconds. It is designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of subtasks and sync functionality later.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quickly Add Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to quickly add tasks so I can capture my thoughts instantly.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental feature of a to-do app.

**Independent Test**: A user can add a task and see it appear in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the task input field is empty, **When** I type "Buy milk" and press Enter, **Then** a new task "Buy milk" appears in the task list.
2.  **Given** the task input field has text, **When** I press Enter, **Then** the input field is cleared.
3.  **Given** the task input field is empty, **When** I press Enter, **Then** no task is added.

### User Story 2 - Edit Tasks Inline (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to edit tasks inline so I can correct or update them easily.

**Why this priority**: Correcting mistakes or changing task details is a core workflow.

**Independent Test**: A user can click on a task, edit its title, and see the updated title in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** an existing task "Buy milk", **When** I click on it and change the text to "Buy almond milk" and press Enter, **Then** the task's title is updated to "Buy almond milk".
2.  **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I click outside the input field, **Then** the task is saved with the current text.

### User Story 3 - Mark Tasks as Completed (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed so I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Visual feedback on progress is a key motivator.

**Independent Test**: A user can check a box next to a task and see its appearance change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** an active task, **When** I click the checkbox next to it, **Then** the task is marked as complete and its appearance changes (e.g., struck through).
2.  **Given** a completed task, **When** I click the checkbox next to it, **Then** the task is marked as active again.

### User Story 4 - Reorder Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to reorder tasks by dragging or using the keyboard.

**Why this priority**: Prioritizing tasks is a key organizational feature.

**Independent Test**: A user can drag a task to a new position in the list, and the order is saved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a list of tasks, **When** I drag a task from the top to the bottom of the list, **Then** the task's position is updated.
2.  **Given** a selected task, **When** I press Ctrl + Shift + â†“, **Then** the task moves down one position in the list.

### User Story 5 - Persist Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want my tasks saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.

**Why this priority**: Data persistence is essential for the app to be useful.

**Independent Test**: Add a task, refresh the page, and the task should still be there.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I have added several tasks, **When** I close and reopen the browser, **Then** all my tasks are still present in the same order.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens when the user tries to add a task with a very long title? (Input validation should handle this).
-   How does the system handle storage being full or unavailable? (The app should show a user-friendly error message).
-   What happens if the user tries to reorder tasks while the filter is active? (The reordering should apply to the underlying "All" list).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add a new task with a title.
-   **FR-002**: System MUST validate that a task title is not empty before adding.

-   **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
-   **FR-005**: System MUST visually distinguish between active and completed tasks.
-   **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to delete a task.
-   **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to reorder tasks using drag and drop.
-   **FR-008**: System MUST persist all tasks and their order in `localStorage`.
-   **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to filter tasks by "All", "Active", and "Completed".
-   **FR-010**: System MUST support a dark and light mode, with auto-detection and manual override.
-   **FR-011**: System MUST provide keyboard shortcuts for adding, editing, and reordering tasks.
-   **FR-012**: System MUST display a message when the task list is empty.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
