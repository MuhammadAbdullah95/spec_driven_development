# Implementation Plan: Modern To-Do List App

**Branch**: `002-a-modern-minimal` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/abdullah/spec_driven_development/practice_gemini/specs/002-a-modern-minimal/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a modern, minimal, and responsive To-Do List App. "Minimal" is defined by focusing on essential task management features and avoiding unnecessary UI elements or complexity. Responsiveness will be achieved through a mobile-first design approach, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The app will be a single-page web application built with TypeScript and Vite, focusing on performance, accessibility, and a clean user experience. "Efficient" means users can capture and manage tasks quickly, with core actions (add, edit, complete) taking less than 2 seconds. It will store data locally in the browser.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite
**Storage**: LocalStorage (abstracted via a service)
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright
**Target Platform**: Web (modern browsers)
**Project Type**: Single Page Web Application
**Performance Goals**: App should load under 1s and remain responsive for 1000+ tasks.
**Constraints**: No backend server; all data is client-side.
**Scale/Scope**: A single-user, local-first to-do list application.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Lint & Format**: The plan includes ESLint and Prettier, enforced via pre-commit hooks.
- [x] **Unit Tests**: The plan includes Vitest for unit tests, targeting 80% unit coverage on core logic modules.
- [x] **E2E Tests**: The plan includes Playwright for E2E tests.
- [x] **Persistence**: The plan includes a `StorageService` for `localStorage`.
- [x] **Performance**: The plan has clear performance goals.
- [x] **Accessibility**: The plan includes accessibility as a core requirement.

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is chosen as this is a client-only web application.
