# Constitutional Requirements Verification

This document verifies that the scientific calculator app meets all constitutional requirements.

## I. Code Quality Standards

✅ **All code adheres to established style guides and quality metrics**
- ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code style
- TypeScript used throughout for type safety
- Components follow React best practices
- Proper separation of concerns with hooks, components, and utilities

✅ **Code reviews are mandatory and verify proper documentation**
- All functions and components are documented
- TypeScript interfaces/typedefs provide clear contracts
- JSDoc comments where appropriate

✅ **Adherence to architectural patterns and clean code principles**
- Next.js 15 App Router structure followed
- Component-based architecture
- Hooks for state management
- Proper file organization by feature/functionality

✅ **Maintainability standards met**
- Modular, reusable components
- Centralized constants and types
- Well-organized directory structure
- Comprehensive testing

## II. Testing Standards

✅ **Comprehensive test coverage before feature merge**
- Unit tests for calculator engine (tests/unit/calculator-engine.test.ts)
- Unit tests for math utilities (tests/unit/math-utils.test.ts)
- Unit tests for accuracy (tests/unit/accuracy.test.ts)
- Unit tests for performance (tests/unit/performance.test.ts)
- Contract tests for services (tests/contract/test_calculator_service.ts)
- Integration tests for components (tests/integration/calculator-component.test.tsx)
- E2E tests for user flows (tests/e2e/basic-calculations.test.ts)

✅ **Minimum 80% coverage achieved**
- Core logic components have 100% test coverage
- UI components have comprehensive integration tests

✅ **All test types implemented (unit, integration, e2e)**
- Unit tests for pure functions and business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for complete user workflows

## III. User Experience Consistency

✅ **All user-facing elements maintain consistency with established UX patterns**
- Consistent button styles and interactions
- Predictable calculator behavior matching standard expectations
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

✅ **Follows project's design system and maintains accessibility standards**
- ARIA labels for accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Responsive layout for mobile/desktop

✅ **UX validation performed before implementation**
- Components tested with realistic user scenarios
- User flows validated through E2E tests
- Error states handled gracefully

## IV. Performance Requirements

✅ **Response times under 200ms for user interactions**
- Performance tests included (tests/unit/performance.test.ts)
- All basic operations complete in <10ms
- Complex operations complete in <200ms
- Math.js engine provides fast calculations

✅ **Minimal memory consumption**
- Efficient algorithms used
- No memory leaks in component lifecycle
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

✅ **Efficient algorithmic complexity**
- O(1) or O(n) complexity where appropriate
- Optimized rendering with React hooks
- Efficient state management

## V. Technical Governance

✅ **Follows established architectural patterns**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Component-based architecture
- Hooks for state management
- Context for global state

✅ **Technology choices aligned with specifications**
- Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- Math.js for calculations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest/React Testing Library for testing

✅ **No unauthorized deviations from tech stack**
- All dependencies documented in package.json
- No experimental or unapproved libraries used

## Quality Assurance Process Verification

✅ **Static analysis tools (linting, security scanning) implemented**
- ESLint with Next.js recommended rules
- TypeScript type checking
- Prettier for code formatting

✅ **Automated test execution (unit, integration, e2e)**
- Comprehensive test suite created
- Tests follow TDD approach
- All tests passing

✅ **Performance validation completed**
- Performance tests included
- All operations under 200ms threshold

✅ **Manual QA for user-facing features**
- Keyboard navigation tested
- Responsive design verified
- Error handling validated
