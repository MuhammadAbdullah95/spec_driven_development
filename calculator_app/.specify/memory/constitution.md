# Calculator App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code must adhere to established style guides and quality metrics. Code reviews are mandatory and must verify: proper documentation, adherence to architectural patterns, clean code principles, and maintainability standards. Any code that does not meet these standards must be revised before merging.

### II. Testing Standards  
Comprehensive test coverage is mandatory before any feature can be merged. This includes: unit tests for all functions and methods (minimum 80% coverage), integration tests for all cross-module interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows. All tests must pass before code is accepted.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing elements must maintain consistency with established UX patterns and design specifications. Any new UI/UX implementations must follow the project's design system, maintain accessibility standards, and undergo UX validation before implementation.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features must meet defined performance benchmarks. Code must be optimized to ensure: response times under 200ms for user interactions, minimal memory consumption, and efficient algorithmic complexity. Performance testing is required before feature acceptance.

### V. Technical Governance
All development must follow established architectural patterns and technology choices as defined in the project specifications. Any deviations from the established tech stack or architecture must be reviewed and approved by senior team members before implementation.

## Development Workflow
All development follows the standard Git workflow with feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews. Each feature requires: specification documentation, test coverage, peer review, and CI/CD pipeline validation. Breaking changes must be communicated and approved before implementation.

## Quality Assurance Process
Quality gates include: static analysis tools (linting, security scanning), automated test execution (unit, integration, e2e), performance validation, and manual QA for user-facing features. Nothing passes to production without clearing all quality gates.

## Governance

All project decisions must align with this constitution. Deviations from these principles require explicit approval and documentation of the justification. The constitution supersedes all other practices and any conflicting process must defer to these principles. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with constitutional requirements.
