# Implementation Plan: Scientific Calculator App

**Branch**: `001-build-a-scientific` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [G:\spec_driven_development\calculator_app\specs\001-build-a-scientific\spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `G:\spec_driven_development\calculator_app\specs\001-build-a-scientific\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Target Platform**: Web browser (client-side application)
**Project Type**: Web application (single project structure)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for calculations, optimized for student use  
**Constraints**: Must support complex math operations, maintain high precision, accessible UI, unique design as specified

**Structure Decision**: Web application with Next.js 15 using App Router structure. The calculator functionality is organized in its own feature directory with dedicated components, hooks, and engine logic. UI components are separated for reusability, and the math calculation engine handles all mathematical operations. Testing is organized by type (unit, integration, e2e) following the testing standards in the constitution.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION in feature spec → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for Next.js v15 in scientific calculator application"
   For each math function requirement:
     Task: "Research math libraries for advanced calculations (algebra, geometry, trigonometry)"
   For each UI requirement:
     Task: "Research UI patterns for calculator interfaces"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For client-side calculator operations → service interfaces
   - Use appropriate patterns for internal service communication
   - Document service contracts to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per service/function
   - Assert input/output schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps
   - Focus on calculator functionality validation

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType qwen`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each service interface → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model/type creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass
- Focus on calculator core engine, UI components, and user experience

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Calculator engine before UI components
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md, with focus on:
- Calculator engine implementation (math operations)
- UI/UX implementation (unique design requirements)
- Advanced function support (algebra, geometry, trigonometry)
- History and error handling features

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Required Clarifications
The following items from the feature specification need clarification before proceeding to implementation:

1. **FR-006**: Calculation precision requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of precision is required for calculations?]
2. **FR-007**: Calculation history retention [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should calculation history be retained?]
3. **FR-008**: Complex number support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Does this include complex number support?]
4. **FR-009**: Error handling behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific error handling behavior is expected?]
5. **FR-010**: UI/UX requirements for students [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific UI/UX requirements for the student audience?]

*Note: These items should be addressed via /clarify command before proceeding to implementation*
