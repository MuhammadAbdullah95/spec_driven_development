# Feature Specification: Scientific Calculator App

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-scientific`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a scientific calculator app for solving complex math problems like algebra, Geometric and other scientific Operations, Students can use that calculator who belongs to math and leaning complex subjetcs like numerical computing etc"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Constitution Alignment**: Ensure all requirements align with constitutional principles:
   - Code Quality: How will this maintain high code quality standards?
   - Testing: What test coverage is required for this feature?
   - UX Consistency: How does this maintain UX consistency?
   - Performance: What performance benchmarks must this meet?
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student studying mathematics or numerical computing, I need a scientific calculator that can solve complex math problems including algebra, geometry, and other scientific operations so that I can efficiently complete my coursework and research.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am using the scientific calculator app, **When** I enter a complex algebraic expression like "2x + 3 = 7", **Then** the calculator should solve for x and display the result "x = 2".
2. **Given** I need to calculate the area of a circle, **When** I enter the radius and select the geometric function for area of a circle, **Then** the calculator should display the correct area using œÄr¬≤ formula.
3. **Given** I am performing a trigonometric calculation, **When** I enter sin(30¬∞), **Then** the calculator should return the correct value of 0.5.
4. **Given** I am working with exponents and logarithms, **When** I enter log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(100), **Then** the calculator should return the correct result of 2.
5. **Given** I am solving a calculus-related problem, **When** I enter a derivative or integral function if supported, **Then** the calculator should return the correct solution.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user enters an invalid mathematical expression?
- How does system handle division by zero or other undefined mathematical operations?
- How does the system handle very large numbers or calculations that result in overflow?
- What happens when the user attempts to calculate the square root of a negative number?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support advanced mathematical functions (trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, logarithms, exponents)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to solve algebraic equations with unknown variables
- **FR-004**: System MUST support geometric calculations (area, volume, angles, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle scientific notation for very large and very small numbers
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide accurate results with precision of at least 10 decimal places
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain at least the last 50 calculations in the history
- **FR-008**: System MUST support complex number calculations [OUT OF SCOPE FOR V1]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide user-friendly error messages for invalid operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST have an intuitive user interface suitable for students with large buttons, clear display, and simple layout

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Calculation**: A mathematical operation performed by the user, including input expression, result, and timestamp
- **User Preferences**: Settings that customize the calculator experience, such as display format, angle units (degrees/radians), precision
- **Calculation History**: A record of recent calculations performed by the user with ability to recall previous results
