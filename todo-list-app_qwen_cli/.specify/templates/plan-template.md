# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Check**: 
- Does the implementation follow project-wide style and formatting setup (ESLint + Prettier or equivalent)?
- Are modules small with single responsibility and clear directory structure?
- Is the public API minimal and documented?
- Does the code use clear naming and avoid deep nesting?
- Is global mutable state avoided in favor of explicit state objects?

**Testing Standards Check**:
- Will unit tests cover all business logic and core UI components?
- Do tests target 80% coverage on core logic modules?
- Will end-to-end tests cover main user flows: add task, edit task, complete task, delete task, drag-and-drop reordering, persistence across reload?
- Are tests deterministic and not reliant on flaky timing?
- Will tests use test IDs for DOM selectors?

**User Experience Consistency Check**:
- Does the design establish and reuse design tokens for spacing, typography scale, and primary colors?
- Are interaction patterns consistent with single primary action per area?
- Does the feature provide clear empty states, loading states, and inline validation?
- Will drag-and-drop be discoverable and accessible (mouse, touch, keyboard alternatives)?
- Is keyboard support available for navigation, toggling, and reordering?

**Performance Requirements Check**:
- Is the implementation mindful of keeping runtime bundle minimal?
- Does the feature target first meaningful paint under 1s on a mid-tier device with warm cache?
- Does it avoid blocking the main thread?

**Accessibility and Internationalization Check**:
- Does the feature use semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA where necessary?
- Are all interactive controls reachable by keyboard?
- Does it ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards?
- Does it maintain separate markup and text to facilitate future translations?

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
