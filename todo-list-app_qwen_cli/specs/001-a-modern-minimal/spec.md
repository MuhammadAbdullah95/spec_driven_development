# Feature Specification: A Modern, Minimal To-Do List App

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-modern-minimal`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A modern, minimal, and responsive To-Do List App that allows users to create, organize, and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app should feel lightweight, start instantly, and store data locally. It should also be designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of subtasks and sync functionality later."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Add and Manage Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to quickly add tasks so I can capture my thoughts instantly. The user can add a new task with a title and optional description. Input should validate (no empty title, reasonable character limit). Hitting Enter quickly adds the task for a fluid workflow. Users should be able to edit tasks inline, rename them, mark them as complete/incomplete using a checkbox toggle, and delete tasks with a small visible delete button.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of a to-do list app - users need to be able to add, edit, and manage tasks to capture and track their work. Without this basic functionality, the app has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks independently of other features. The app remains a functional to-do list with just this core functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the app, **When** user enters a task title and presses Enter, **Then** the task appears in the list with default active status
2. **Given** user has an existing task, **When** user clicks to edit and changes the title then presses Enter, **Then** the task title updates in the list
3. **Given** user has an active task, **When** user clicks the checkbox, **Then** the task appears visually distinct as completed (dimmed, struck through)
4. **Given** user has a task in the list, **When** user clicks the delete button, **Then** the task is removed from the list

### User Story 2 - Task Organization and Persistence (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to reorder tasks by dragging or using the keyboard and have my tasks saved even after refreshing or closing the browser. The user can reorder tasks up or down in the list using drag and drop, and the new order persists automatically in localStorage. Tasks and their order persist between page reloads.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the usability of the core task management functionality by allowing users to organize their tasks in order of priority or context, and ensures data isn't lost when the browser is closed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reordering tasks and refreshing the page to verify the order persists independently of other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple tasks in the list, **When** user drags a task to a new position, **Then** the task moves to that position and the new order persists
2. **Given** user has organized tasks in a specific order, **When** user refreshes the page, **Then** the tasks appear in the same order as before the refresh

---

### User Story 3 - Filtering and Theme Management (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to filter by completed or active tasks to focus on specific work and want the interface to match my system's dark or light mode. The app should provide three simple filters (All, Active, Completed) that update instantly and persist the selected view across sessions. The app should auto-detect the system theme and allow manual override, storing the user's preference locally.

**Why this priority**: These features enhance the user experience by allowing better organization of tasks and visual comfort, but the app remains functional without them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying filters and changing theme settings independently of core task management features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has both active and completed tasks, **When** user selects "Active" filter, **Then** only active tasks are displayed
2. **Given** user has preferences for dark/light mode, **When** user toggles theme or system theme changes, **Then** the app interface updates to match the selected theme

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to add a task with an empty title?
- How does system handle adding tasks with very long titles that exceed reasonable character limits?
- What happens to the task order when tasks are added, completed, or deleted during a filtering view?
- How does the system handle localStorage being unavailable or full?
- What happens when the user has more than 5 tasks and wants to delete multiple tasks (confirmation requirement)?
