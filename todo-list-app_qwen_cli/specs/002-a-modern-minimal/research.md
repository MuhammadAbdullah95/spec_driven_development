# Research: A Modern, Minimal To-Do List App

**Feature**: A Modern, Minimal To-Do List App  
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Branch**: `002-a-modern-minimal`

## Research Summary

This research document outlines the technical decisions for implementing the To-Do List App, covering technology choices, architecture patterns, and implementation approaches based on the feature specification and project constitution.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Frontend Build - Vite
**Rationale**: Vite offers fast local development with hot module replacement, minimal configuration overhead, and excellent TypeScript support. It provides modern build features while maintaining simplicity that aligns with the "minimal dependencies" principle.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Webpack: More complex configuration, slower development server
- Parcel: Less control over build process, potentially larger bundles
- Vanilla build scripts: More maintenance overhead

### Decision: Language - TypeScript
**Rationale**: Provides type safety which reduces runtime errors, improves maintainability, and enhances developer experience with better autocompletion and refactoring. Aligns with constitution's "code quality and maintainability" principle.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain JavaScript: No type safety, more runtime errors
- Flow: Less ecosystem support than TypeScript

### Decision: UI Framework - Vanilla with DOM APIs
**Rationale**: Staying with vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript DOM APIs keeps the application lightweight, fast, and with minimal dependencies as required by the constitution. Reduces bundle size and complexity while providing full control over the UI.

**Alternatives considered**:
- React: Adds significant bundle size and complexity for simple app
- Vue: Adds framework overhead not needed for this use case
- Svelte: Still adds framework code and learning curve

### Decision: State Management - Simple Reactive Store
**Rationale**: A custom reactive store using TypeScript classes or signals pattern provides necessary state management without the complexity or overhead of full frameworks. Aligns with "small, single-responsibility modules" principle.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux: Overkill for simple local state management
- Zustand: Still adds external dependency unnecessarily
- Context API (if using React): Not applicable to vanilla approach

### Decision: Persistence - LocalStorage with Abstraction
**Rationale**: LocalStorage meets requirement for client-side persistence, keeping data local as per security requirements. The abstraction layer allows for future replacement with IndexedDB or SQLite as mentioned in the specification.

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: More complex API, unnecessary for current requirements
- Cookies: Limited storage capacity, inappropriate for task data
- SessionStorage: Data lost on browser close

### Decision: Testing - Vitest + Playwright
**Rationale**: Vitest provides fast unit testing with good TypeScript integration, while Playwright offers reliable E2E testing across browsers. Both align with "lightweight tooling that fits the stack" requirement.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Node.js focused, slower than Vitest
- Cypress: More complex setup than Playwright for this use case
- Puppeteer: More complex APIs than Playwright

### Decision: Styling - CSS Modules or Tailwind
**Rationale**: CSS Modules provide scoped styling without specificity conflicts, while Tailwind provides utility-first approach for rapid development. Either approach supports design token consistency as required.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled components: Requires additional runtime
- Traditional CSS: Prone to specificity conflicts
- Sass/SCSS: Additional build step not necessary

## Architecture Research

### Decision: Module Structure - Feature-Sliced with Clear Boundaries
**Rationale**: Organizing code into distinct modules (models, services, components, utils) creates clear separation of concerns, improves testability, and aligns with "small, single-responsibility modules" principle from the constitution.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic approach: Harder to maintain and test
- Framework-specific patterns: Overly complex for vanilla implementation

### Decision: Event-Driven State Updates
**Rationale**: Using a simple event system allows components to react to state changes without tight coupling, supporting the "consistent user experience" principle by ensuring UI updates happen predictably.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct manipulation: Leads to inconsistent state updates
- Complex state patterns: Overkill for simple to-do list

## Implementation Patterns

### Decision: Declarative DOM Updates
**Rationale**: Building DOM updates based on state snapshots rather than imperative manipulation reduces bugs and makes the UI behavior more predictable, supporting accessibility requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual DOM manipulation: More error-prone, harder to maintain
- Virtual DOM: Adds complexity not needed for this app size

### Decision: Keyboard Navigation Support
**Rationale**: Building in keyboard accessibility from the start ensures compliance with WCAG AA standards and meets the "accessibility" requirement in the constitution.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Adding later: More expensive to retrofit accessibility

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Debounced Persistence
**Rationale**: Using debounced writes to LocalStorage prevents excessive I/O operations during rapid state changes, maintaining responsiveness as required by performance standards.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Immediate writes: Could block main thread
- Batched writes: More complex to implement correctly

### Decision: CSS Transitions for Animations
**Rationale**: Using CSS for animations keeps them off the main JavaScript thread, maintaining 60fps performance as required by the constitution.

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript animations: More likely to cause jank
- Canvas-based animations: Overly complex for simple UI transitions

## Security Research

### Decision: Input Sanitization
**Rationale**: All task titles and descriptions will be inserted into the DOM using textContent or properly escaped values to prevent XSS, in line with security requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Trusting user input: Creates security vulnerabilities
- Heavy sanitization libraries: Adds unnecessary bundle size
