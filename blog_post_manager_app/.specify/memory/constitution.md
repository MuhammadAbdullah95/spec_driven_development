# FastAPI Blog Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. RESTful API Design & Resource Modeling

**MUST**: Follow REST architectural constraints with clear, hierarchical resource naming.

- Resources MUST use plural nouns (e.g., `/posts`, `/authors`, `/comments`)
- HTTP methods MUST map semantically: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove)
- Nested resources MUST reflect ownership (e.g., `/posts/{post_id}/comments`)
- Endpoints MUST NOT use verbs in paths (e.g., use `POST /posts` not `/posts/create`)
- All responses MUST include appropriate HTTP status codes (2xx success, 4xx client error, 5xx server error)
- HATEOAS links SHOULD be included for navigable resources when appropriate

**Rationale**: Consistent REST patterns reduce cognitive load, enable API discoverability, and ensure predictable client integration. Clear resource modeling prevents endpoint proliferation and maintains API coherence as the system scales.

### II. Input Validation & Error Handling

**MUST**: Validate all inputs at API boundaries with comprehensive error responses.

- All request bodies MUST be validated using Pydantic models with explicit field constraints
- Validation errors MUST return 422 Unprocessable Entity with detailed field-level error messages
- Business logic errors MUST return appropriate 4xx codes (400 Bad Request, 409 Conflict, etc.)
- Error responses MUST follow a consistent schema: `{error: string, details: object, request_id: string}`
- Path parameters and query parameters MUST be validated with type constraints and bounds
- File uploads MUST validate MIME types, file sizes, and content structure
- All exceptions MUST be caught and logged with request context before returning user-safe messages

**Rationale**: Robust validation prevents invalid data from reaching the business layer or database, reducing debugging time and security vulnerabilities. Consistent error structures enable clients to handle failures programmatically and provide actionable user feedback.

### III. Database Integrity & Performance

**MUST**: Maintain normalized schemas with enforced referential integrity and optimized access patterns.

- Database schemas MUST be in at least 3rd Normal Form (3NF) unless denormalization is explicitly justified for performance
- Foreign key constraints MUST be defined in the database (not just application layer)
- All tables MUST have primary keys (prefer UUIDs for distributed systems or auto-increment for single-instance)
- Indexes MUST be created for all foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Cascade delete rules MUST be explicit (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT) and documented
- Migrations MUST be reversible and tested in staging before production
- Database transactions MUST wrap multi-statement operations to ensure atomicity
- Connection pooling MUST be configured with appropriate min/max pool sizes

**Rationale**: Normalized designs prevent update anomalies and data inconsistency. Database-level constraints provide a last line of defense against application bugs. Proper indexing prevents performance degradation as data scales. Explicit cascade rules prevent accidental data loss.

### IV. Test-Driven Quality Assurance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST**: Write tests BEFORE implementation; tests MUST fail before code is written.

- **Test-first workflow (strictly enforced)**: Write test → Test fails (RED) → Implement → Test passes (GREEN) → Refactor → Repeat
- Minimum coverage targets:
  - Unit tests: 85% code coverage for business logic and models
  - Integration tests: All API endpoints with success and error cases
  - Contract tests: All public API contracts validated against OpenAPI spec
- Test pyramid MUST be maintained: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal end-to-end tests
- Tests MUST be independent (no test execution order dependencies)
- Test databases MUST use isolated instances or transactions (never shared state)
- Mocking MUST be minimized in integration tests (use real database, mock external services only)
- CI pipeline MUST fail builds if coverage drops below thresholds

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are testable, reduces defects by 40-80% (industry studies), and creates living documentation. Tests failing first proves they actually detect regressions. High coverage combined with test isolation ensures refactoring safety and system reliability in production.

### V. Security & Authorization

**MUST**: Implement defense-in-depth with secure-by-default patterns for authentication and authorization.

- Authentication MUST use industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, JWT, or session tokens)
- Passwords MUST be hashed using bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt (never MD5/SHA-256)
- JWT tokens MUST have expiration times (≤15 min for access tokens, ≤7 days for refresh tokens)
- Authorization MUST be checked at the endpoint level (not just middleware) using role-based access control (RBAC)
- Sensitive data MUST NOT appear in logs, error messages, or URLs
- SQL injection MUST be prevented using parameterized queries (ORMs like SQLAlchemy enforce this)
- CORS policies MUST be explicitly configured (no wildcard origins in production)
- API rate limiting MUST be implemented (e.g., 100 requests/min per user)
- Secrets MUST be stored in environment variables or secret managers (never committed to version control)

**Rationale**: Security breaches have catastrophic consequences for user trust and legal compliance. Defense-in-depth means no single failure compromises the system. Secure defaults prevent common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and reduce attack surface.

### VI. Query Optimization & Pagination

**MUST**: Design efficient database queries with cursor-based pagination for scalable data access.

- N+1 query problems MUST be eliminated using eager loading (e.g., SQLAlchemy `joinedload`, `selectinload`)
- List endpoints MUST implement pagination (default page size: 20, max: 100)
- Pagination MUST use cursor-based approaches for large datasets (not offset-based which degrades with scale)
- Query performance MUST be profiled in staging with production-scale data
- Database query times MUST NOT exceed 200ms at p95 for single-record lookups
- Full table scans MUST be avoided (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to verify index usage)
- Eager loading strategies MUST be documented in model relationships
- Read replicas SHOULD be used for read-heavy workloads when traffic exceeds single-instance capacity

**Rationale**: Poorly optimized queries are the #1 cause of production performance issues. Cursor pagination ensures consistent performance regardless of dataset size. N+1 queries can degrade response times from 50ms to 5+ seconds. Profiling catches regressions before they reach production.

### VII. API Documentation Standards

**MUST**: Maintain accurate, auto-generated OpenAPI documentation synchronized with implementation.

- All endpoints MUST have OpenAPI schema definitions generated from Pydantic models
- Each endpoint MUST include: summary, description, parameter descriptions, response schemas, and example payloads
- Status codes MUST be documented with corresponding response schemas (e.g., 200, 404, 422, 500)
- FastAPI's auto-generated docs MUST be accessible at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` (ReDoc)
- Breaking API changes MUST trigger API version increments (e.g., `/v1/posts` → `/v2/posts`)
- Deprecation warnings MUST be documented 2 versions before removal
- API changelog MUST be maintained documenting additions, changes, and deprecations

**Rationale**: Accurate documentation reduces integration time for clients and prevents miscommunication. Auto-generated docs from code ensure documentation never drifts from implementation. Versioning strategies prevent breaking existing clients while allowing API evolution.

### VIII. Containerization & Image Optimization

**MUST**: Build secure, minimal Docker images optimized for production deployment.

- Base images MUST use official, minimal variants (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`, not full `python:3.11`)
- Multi-stage builds MUST be used to exclude build tools from runtime images
- Final image size MUST be <500MB for FastAPI applications
- Non-root users MUST run application processes (security best practice)
- Dependencies MUST be pinned to exact versions in `requirements.txt` (no floating versions)
- Health check endpoints MUST be implemented (`/health` returning 200 when ready)
- Images MUST be scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) before deployment
- `.dockerignore` MUST exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.git`, `tests/`, `__pycache__`)

**Rationale**: Smaller images deploy faster, reduce storage costs, and minimize attack surface. Multi-stage builds separate build-time from runtime dependencies. Pinned dependencies ensure reproducible builds. Health checks enable orchestrators to detect failures and restart unhealthy containers.

### IX. Cloud-Native Deployment Architecture

**MUST**: Design for horizontal scalability, observability, and resilience in distributed environments.

- Application MUST be stateless (no local file storage; use object storage like S3 for files)
- Configuration MUST be externalized via environment variables (12-factor app principle)
- Logs MUST be written to stdout/stderr (not files) for centralized log aggregation
- Metrics MUST be exposed in Prometheus format at `/metrics` endpoint
- Distributed tracing MUST be implemented using OpenTelemetry or similar standards
- Database connection pooling MUST support horizontal scaling (connection pool size × instance count < DB max connections)
- Graceful shutdown MUST be implemented (handle SIGTERM to finish in-flight requests)
- Zero-downtime deployments MUST use rolling updates with readiness probes
- Resource limits MUST be defined (CPU, memory requests/limits) for Kubernetes pods

**Rationale**: Stateless design enables auto-scaling and simplifies deployments. Externalized config enables same image to run in dev/staging/prod. Structured logging and metrics enable observability in production. Graceful shutdown prevents dropped requests during deployments. Resource limits prevent resource starvation and enable predictable scaling.

## Development Standards

**Code Quality**:
- Code MUST pass linting (ruff or flake8) and type checking (mypy) in CI pipeline
- All functions MUST have type hints (PEP 484)
- Docstrings MUST follow Google or NumPy style for public APIs
- Cyclomatic complexity MUST NOT exceed 10 per function (use code analysis tools)

**Dependency Management**:
- New dependencies MUST be justified (evaluate alternatives, assess maintenance status)
- Dependencies MUST be tracked in `pyproject.toml` (Poetry) or `requirements.txt` (pip)
- Dependency updates MUST be tested in CI before merging

**Git Workflow**:
- Feature branches MUST follow naming convention: `###-feature-name` (e.g., `001-user-authentication`)
- Commits MUST have descriptive messages following Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- Pull requests MUST reference issues and include summary of changes
