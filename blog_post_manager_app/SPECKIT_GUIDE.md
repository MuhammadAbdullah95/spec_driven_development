# üéØ Building with SpecKit - Complete Guide

## What is SpecKit?

**SpecKit** is a spec-driven development workflow for Claude Code that helps you build production-ready applications systematically. Instead of diving straight into code, you first establish principles, write specifications, and plan implementation - resulting in consistent, well-documented, and maintainable software.

---

## üåü Why Spec-Driven Development?

### Traditional Approach Problems
- ‚ùå Inconsistent code structure
- ‚ùå Missing documentation
- ‚ùå Ad-hoc decisions
- ‚ùå Hard to onboard new developers
- ‚ùå Technical debt accumulates

### SpecKit Solution
- ‚úÖ Consistent architecture from principles
- ‚úÖ Living documentation (spec as truth)
- ‚úÖ Systematic task breakdown
- ‚úÖ Clear implementation roadmap
- ‚úÖ Quality built-in from start

## üöÄ The 5-Step SpecKit Workflow

### Step 1: Define Principles (`/speckit.constitution`)

**Purpose:** Establish architectural standards and coding principles that guide all decisions.

**Command:**
```
/speckit.constitution Create principles for a production-ready FastAPI blog management system focusing on: RESTful API design with clear resource naming and HTTP method usage, comprehensive input validation and error handling, database normalization and referential integrity, automated testing with high coverage standards, secure authentication and authorization patterns, efficient query performance and pagination strategies, clear API documentation with OpenAPI standards, containerization best practices with minimal image sizes, and scalable deployment architecture for cloud-native environments
```

**Creates:** `constitution.md`

**Contains:**
- API design principles
- Data modeling standards
- Testing requirements (85% coverage)
- Security best practices
- Performance guidelines
- Documentation standards
- Deployment principles

**Example Principle:**
```markdown
## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Maintain minimum 85% test coverage
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Use pytest with async support
```

---

### Step 2: Write Specification (`/speckit.specify`)

**Purpose:** Document features and requirements in natural language.

**Command:**
```
/speckit.specify Build a blog post management application where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Each blog post has a title, content body, excerpt/summary, publication status (draft, published, archived), publication date, author information, and multiple tags for categorization. Users should be able to filter posts by status, tags, and author, search posts by title or content, sort posts by publication date or title, and retrieve paginated lists of posts. The application needs user authentication where authors can only edit or delete their own posts, but all published posts are publicly readable. Each post can have multiple tags, and tags can be reused across different posts. The system should track creation and modification timestamps for all posts and provide meaningful validation messages for all operations.
```

**Creates:** `spec.md`

**Contains:**
- Feature descriptions
- User stories
- Data requirements
- Business rules
- Validation requirements
- Success criteria

**Example from spec.md:**
```markdown
### User Authentication
Users must authenticate to create, update, or delete posts.
Each user has:
- Email (unique)
- Username (unique)
- Password (hashed)
- Full name

Authors can only modify their own posts.
```

---

### Step 3: Plan Implementation (`/speckit.plan`)

**Purpose:** Design technical architecture and choose technology stack.

**Command:**
```
/speckit.plan The application uses FastAPI framework with Python 3.11+, uv as the package manager for fast dependency management and virtual environment handling, PostgreSQL as the relational database with proper indexing on frequently queried fields, SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations with relationship management for posts-tags many-to-many association, Alembic for database migrations with version control, Pydantic V2 for request/response validation and serialization, JWT tokens with refresh token mechanism for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, pytest with pytest-asyncio for comprehensive testing including unit and integration tests, SQLAlchemy test fixtures for database testing, Docker for containerization using multi-stage builds with uv for faster dependency installation and minimal image size, docker-compose for local development environment with PostgreSQL service, and Kubernetes for production deployment with separate manifests for deployment, service, configmap, and secrets. Include health check endpoints, CORS middleware configuration, rate limiting, and structured logging with correlation IDs. Use pyproject.toml for dependency management with uv.
```

**Creates:** `plan.md`

**Contains:**
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture design
- Database schema
- API endpoint structure
- Security approach
- Testing strategy
- Deployment architecture

**Example from plan.md:**
```markdown
### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async)
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Testing**: pytest + pytest-asyncio
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes
```

---

### Step 4: Generate Tasks (`/speckit.tasks`)

**Purpose:** Break down implementation into actionable tasks.

**Command:**
```
/speckit.tasks
```

**Creates:** `tasks.md`

**Contains:**
- ~136 implementation tasks
- Organized by phase:
  - Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)
  - Phase 2: Database (12 tasks)
  - Phase 3: Authentication (18 tasks)
  - Phase 4: Blog Posts (24 tasks)
  - Phase 5: Tags (16 tasks)
  - Phase 6: Search (14 tasks)
  - Phase 7: Middleware (12 tasks)
  - Phase 8: Testing (27 tasks)
  - Phase 9: Deployment (8 tasks)
- Dependencies between tasks
- Acceptance criteria

**Example Tasks:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

### Task 1.1: Initialize Project Structure
- Create directory structure
- Initialize git repository
- Create pyproject.toml with uv

### Task 1.2: Configure Environment
- Create .env.example
- Set up database connection
- Configure logging
```

---

### Step 5: Execute Implementation (`/speckit.implement`)

**Purpose:** Systematically implement all tasks.

**Command:**
```
/speckit.implement
```

**What Happens:**
Claude reads `tasks.md` and implements each task in order:

1. **Creates code structure**
   - `src/` directory with all modules
   - `tests/` directory with test suites
   - `alembic/` for migrations
   - `k8s/` for Kubernetes

2. **Writes application code**
   - Database models
   - Pydantic schemas
   - API endpoints
   - Business logic (services)
   - Middleware

3. **Implements tests**
   - 42 unit tests
   - 46 integration tests
   - 14 contract tests
   - Achieves 87% coverage

4. **Creates deployment**
   - Dockerfile (multi-stage)
   - docker-compose.yml
   - Kubernetes manifests
   - CI/CD workflows

5. **Writes documentation**
   - README.md
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides

## üéì Key SpecKit Concepts

### 1. Constitution (Principles)
**Think of it as:** Your project's "laws" that never change.

**Examples:**
- "All API endpoints must use proper HTTP methods"
- "Maintain 85% test coverage"
- "Use async/await for database operations"

### 2. Specification (Requirements)
**Think of it as:** What you want to build, in plain English.

**Examples:**
- "Users can create blog posts with title and content"
- "Posts can have multiple tags"
- "Authors can only edit their own posts"

### 3. Plan (Architecture)
**Think of it as:** How you'll build it technically.

**Examples:**
- "Use FastAPI for REST API"
- "PostgreSQL for data storage"
- "JWT for authentication"

### 4. Tasks (Breakdown)
**Think of it as:** Step-by-step instructions.

**Examples:**
- "Create User model in database"
- "Implement /auth/register endpoint"
- "Write tests for authentication"

### 5. Implementation (Execution)
**Think of it as:** Actually building it systematically.

**Result:** Working, tested, documented code.

## üí° SpecKit Best Practices

### 1. Start with Clear Principles
```
‚úÖ Good: "All database queries must use async operations"
‚ùå Bad: "Make it fast"
```

### 2. Write Detailed Specifications
```
‚úÖ Good: "Users can filter posts by status (draft, published, archived),
         tags, and author. Results are paginated with 20 items per page."
‚ùå Bad: "Add some filters"
```

### 3. Specify Complete Tech Stack
```
‚úÖ Good: "FastAPI 0.104+, PostgreSQL 15+, SQLAlchemy 2.0, uv for dependencies"
‚ùå Bad: "Use Python and a database"
```

### 4. Let Tasks Be Generated
```
‚úÖ Do: Run /speckit.tasks and let it break down the work
‚ùå Don't: Try to manually create task lists
```

### 5. Trust the Process
```
‚úÖ Do: Follow the 5 steps in order
‚ùå Don't: Jump straight to /speckit.implement
```
