# 🎯 SpecKit Commands - Quick Reference

## The 5 Commands That Built This Project

Copy and paste these commands into Claude Code to recreate this entire project!

---

## 1️⃣ Establish Principles

```
/speckit.constitution Create principles for a production-ready FastAPI blog management system focusing on: RESTful API design with clear resource naming and HTTP method usage, comprehensive input validation and error handling, database normalization and referential integrity, automated testing with high coverage standards, secure authentication and authorization patterns, efficient query performance and pagination strategies, clear API documentation with OpenAPI standards, containerization best practices with minimal image sizes, and scalable deployment architecture for cloud-native environments
```

**Creates:** `constitution.md`
**Time:** ~30 seconds
**Result:** Architectural principles and coding standards

---

## 2️⃣ Write Specification

```
/speckit.specify Build a blog post management application where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Each blog post has a title, content body, excerpt/summary, publication status (draft, published, archived), publication date, author information, and multiple tags for categorization. Users should be able to filter posts by status, tags, and author, search posts by title or content, sort posts by publication date or title, and retrieve paginated lists of posts. The application needs user authentication where authors can only edit or delete their own posts, but all published posts are publicly readable. Each post can have multiple tags, and tags can be reused across different posts. The system should track creation and modification timestamps for all posts and provide meaningful validation messages for all operations.
```

**Creates:** `spec.md`
**Time:** ~30 seconds
**Result:** Feature requirements in natural language

---

## 3️⃣ Design Architecture

```
/speckit.plan The application uses FastAPI framework with Python 3.11+, uv as the package manager for fast dependency management and virtual environment handling, PostgreSQL as the relational database with proper indexing on frequently queried fields, SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations with relationship management for posts-tags many-to-many association, Alembic for database migrations with version control, Pydantic V2 for request/response validation and serialization, JWT tokens with refresh token mechanism for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, pytest with pytest-asyncio for comprehensive testing including unit and integration tests, SQLAlchemy test fixtures for database testing, Docker for containerization using multi-stage builds with uv for faster dependency installation and minimal image size, docker-compose for local development environment with PostgreSQL service, and Kubernetes for production deployment with separate manifests for deployment, service, configmap, and secrets. Include health check endpoints, CORS middleware configuration, rate limiting, and structured logging with correlation IDs. Use pyproject.toml for dependency management with uv.
```

**Creates:** `plan.md`
**Time:** ~30 seconds
**Result:** Technical architecture and technology stack

---

## 4️⃣ Generate Tasks

```
/speckit.tasks
```

**Creates:** `tasks.md`
**Time:** ~1 minute
**Result:** 136 actionable implementation tasks

---

## 5️⃣ Execute Implementation

```
/speckit.implement
```

**Creates:** Everything!
- Complete application code (`src/`)
- Database migrations (`alembic/`)
- Comprehensive tests (`tests/`)
- Docker configuration
- Kubernetes manifests (`k8s/`)
- CI/CD pipelines (`.github/workflows/`)
- Full documentation

**Time:** ~30 minutes
**Result:** Production-ready application

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Enable SpecKit (should be enabled by default)
3. Create a new directory

### Run Commands
```bash
# 1. Create project directory
mkdir my-blog-api
cd my-blog-api

# 2. Open in Claude Code
code .

# 3. Run the 5 commands above in sequence
# (Copy-paste into Claude Code)

# 4. Wait ~45 minutes

# 5. Done! You have a production-ready app
```

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### Copy-Paste Friendly
All commands above are ready to copy-paste into Claude Code. Just:
1. Copy the command
2. Paste into Claude Code chat
3. Press Enter
4. Wait for completion

### Run in Order
Always run commands in this order:
1. Constitution (principles)
2. Specify (requirements)
3. Plan (architecture)
4. Tasks (breakdown)
5. Implement (execution)

### Customize Commands
Want different features? Modify the commands:

**Example - Add GraphQL:**
```
/speckit.plan [same as above], and GraphQL endpoint using Strawberry for advanced queries
```

**Example - Different database:**
```
/speckit.plan [replace PostgreSQL with] MongoDB as the NoSQL database
```

**Example - Add features:**
```
/speckit.specify [original spec], and add user profile management with avatar uploads
```
