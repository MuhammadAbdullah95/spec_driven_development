## 🚧 Remaining Phases

### Phase 9: Contract Tests (OpenAPI Validation) - NOT STARTED

**Purpose**: Ensure API responses match OpenAPI specifications

**Tasks (~6 tasks)**:
- [ ] Install OpenAPI validation library (openapi-spec-validator or schemathesis)
- [ ] Create contract test for auth endpoints
- [ ] Create contract test for posts endpoints
- [ ] Create contract test for search endpoints
- [ ] Create contract test for tags endpoints
- [ ] Validate request/response schemas against contracts/*.yaml

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Phase 10: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Prometheus metrics endpoint
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Rate limiting setup (slowapi configured)

**Remaining Tasks (~35 tasks)**:

#### Docker & Deployment (~15 tasks)
- [ ] Create multi-stage Dockerfile (builder + runtime)
- [ ] Optimize Docker image (<500MB target)
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Create docker-compose.prod.yml
- [ ] Add health checks to containers
- [ ] Create .dockerignore

#### Kubernetes (~12 tasks)
- [ ] Create k8s/namespace.yaml
- [ ] Create k8s/deployment.yaml (with replicas, health checks, resource limits)
- [ ] Create k8s/service.yaml (ClusterIP)
- [ ] Create k8s/ingress.yaml
- [ ] Create k8s/configmap.yaml
- [ ] Create k8s/secrets.yaml (template)
- [ ] Create k8s/hpa.yaml (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
- [ ] Add liveness and readiness probes
- [ ] Configure rolling updates
- [ ] Add Prometheus ServiceMonitor
- [ ] Create k8s/README.md with deployment instructions

#### Documentation (~5 tasks)
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add API usage examples
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Add architecture diagram
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md

#### CI/CD (~3 tasks)
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/test.yml (run tests on PR)
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/build.yml (build Docker image)
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml (optional)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Time**: 3-4 hours
- Create Dockerfile and docker-compose
- Enable easy deployment anywhere
- Required for production deployment

### Option 3: Kubernetes Setup
**Time**: 4-5 hours
- Create K8s manifests
- Enable cloud-native deployment
- Scalability and high availability

### Option 4: Documentation
**Time**: 2-3 hours
- Comprehensive README
- API usage guide

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Priority Order**:

1. **Contract Tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Completes testing phase
   - Ensures API correctness
   - Low effort, high value

2. **Docker Setup** (3-4 hours)
   - Enables easy deployment
   - Portable across environments
   - Essential for production

3. **Documentation** (2-3 hours)
   - Makes project usable by others
   - Important for maintenance
   - Good for portfolio

4. **Kubernetes** (4-5 hours)
   - Only if deploying to K8s
   - Can skip if using simpler hosting
   - Nice to have, not essential

5. **CI/CD** (2-3 hours)
   - Automates quality checks
   - Useful for team collaboration
   - Can add incrementally

✅ Complete database schema with triggers
✅ Full authentication system (JWT)
✅ CRUD operations for all resources
✅ Full-text search with PostgreSQL
✅ 88 comprehensive tests
