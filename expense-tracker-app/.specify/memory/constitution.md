# Expense Tracker App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular & Readable Code

All code MUST be organized into well-defined, single-responsibility modules with clear interfaces.
Functions and classes MUST have descriptive names and documentation explaining purpose and usage.
Code readability takes precedence over clever optimizations unless performance requirements dictate otherwise.

**Rationale**: Modular architecture enables independent testing, easier debugging, and team scalability.
Readable code reduces onboarding time and maintenance burden over the project lifecycle.

### II. Phased Data Persistence

Data persistence MUST follow a phased approach:
- **Phase 1 (MANDATORY)**: Local storage (browser localStorage or equivalent) for all CRUD operations
- **Phase 2 (OPTIONAL)**: Database integration (SQL/NoSQL) as an enhancement without breaking Phase 1 contracts

All data access MUST be abstracted through a storage interface to enable seamless Phase 1→2 migration.

**Rationale**: Local storage enables rapid prototyping and offline-first functionality. The abstraction
layer ensures database integration does not require rewriting business logic, reducing migration risk.

### III. Intuitive & Responsive UI

The user interface MUST be intuitive (self-explanatory without documentation) and responsive
(functional across desktop, tablet, mobile viewports).

UI components MUST:
- Follow consistent design patterns (colors, spacing, typography)
- Provide clear feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages)
- Be accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

**Rationale**: User experience directly impacts adoption. Responsive design ensures broad accessibility.
Consistency reduces cognitive load and builds user confidence.

### IV. Test-Driven Feature Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature MUST include test cases covering:
- **Unit tests**: Core logic and utility functions
- **Integration tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **Contract tests** (if applicable): API endpoints and data persistence layer

Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation where feasible (Red-Green-Refactor cycle encouraged).
All tests MUST pass before feature is considered complete.

**Rationale**: Testing ensures correctness, prevents regressions, and serves as living documentation.
TDD reduces debugging time and enforces modular design by making untestable code visible early.

### V. Extensible Categories & Analytics

Expense categories and analytics features MUST be designed for extensibility:
- Category system MUST support user-defined categories without code changes
- Analytics engine MUST allow new metrics/visualizations via plugin or configuration
- Data schema MUST accommodate future fields without breaking existing functionality

**Rationale**: User needs evolve. Hardcoded categories and rigid analytics become maintenance bottlenecks.
Extensibility enables customization without forking or rewriting core systems.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Gates

All pull requests MUST:
- Pass automated linting (ESLint, Prettier, or equivalent)
- Include documentation for public APIs
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Have no console errors or warnings in production builds

### Version Control

- Feature branches MUST follow naming convention: `###-feature-name`
- Commit messages MUST be descriptive (what changed and why)
- Merge to main ONLY after PR review and CI passing

### Modularity Requirements

Each module MUST:
- Export a clear, documented interface
- Minimize dependencies on other modules
- Be independently testable without full application bootstrap

## Testing Requirements

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/          # Pure function and class logic tests
├── integration/   # Multi-component interaction tests
└── contract/      # API and storage layer contract tests (if applicable)
```

### Test Coverage Expectations

- **Critical paths** (expense CRUD, calculation logic): 90%+ coverage REQUIRED
- **UI components**: Render and interaction tests REQUIRED
- **Utilities**: 80%+ coverage expected
- **Edge cases**: Null/undefined, boundary values, error conditions MUST be tested

### Test Execution

Tests MUST run in CI/CD pipeline. Failing tests BLOCK merges to main branch.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Propose amendment via issue or discussion with rationale
2. Demonstrate how change improves project maintainability, user value, or team efficiency
3. Update constitution version following semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Principle removal, incompatible governance change
   - **MINOR** (0.X.0): New principle added, expanded requirements
   - **PATCH** (0.0.X): Clarifications, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements
4. Update `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` to amendment approval date
5. Propagate changes to affected templates (plan, spec, tasks)

### Compliance Review

Constitution compliance MUST be verified at:
- **Specification phase**: Requirements must align with principles (spec-template.md)
- **Planning phase**: Design must demonstrate compliance (plan-template.md Constitution Check)
- **Implementation phase**: Code reviews must reference relevant principles
- **Release phase**: Pre-release checklist must confirm testing and modularity standards

### Conflict Resolution

When constitution conflicts with pragmatic needs:
1. Document the conflict in plan.md Complexity Tracking table
2. Justify why deviation is necessary
3. Propose simpler alternative and explain why it was rejected
4. Time-box deviation (e.g., "acceptable until Phase 2") if temporary

Constitution principles are GUIDELINES informed by project experience. Blind adherence that
harms user value or team velocity should trigger amendment discussion, not silent violation.
