## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Check Current Weather for a City (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly check the current weather conditions for a specific location to decide what to wear or whether to go outside. They enter a city name and immediately see the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality. Users need current weather information as the primary value proposition. Without this, the application provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a city name and verifying that current weather data (temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, icon) appears within 2 seconds. This delivers immediate value without requiring any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the weather application, **When** they enter "London" in the search bar and submit, **Then** they see the current temperature, weather condition description, humidity percentage, wind speed, and a matching weather icon for London
2. **Given** the user has viewed weather for one city, **When** they enter a different city name "Tokyo", **Then** the display updates to show Tokyo's current weather information
3. **Given** the user wants precise location data, **When** they enter coordinates "40.7128,-74.0060", **Then** they see current weather for that exact location (New York City)
4. **Given** the user enters an invalid city name "XYZ123", **When** they submit the search, **Then** they see a clear error message like "City not found. Please check the spelling and try again"
5. **Given** the weather service is temporarily unavailable, **When** the user searches for a city, **Then** they see a friendly message like "Unable to fetch weather data right now. Please try again in a moment"

### User Story 2 - View 3-Day Forecast (Priority: P2)

A user wants to plan ahead for the next few days by viewing the weather forecast. After searching for a city, they can see the forecast for the next 3 days, including minimum and maximum temperatures for each day.

**Why this priority**: Forecast data enables planning and decision-making beyond the current moment. This is valuable but not essential for the MVP - current weather alone provides utility.

**Independent Test**: After implementing current weather (US1), this can be tested by searching for any city and verifying that a 3-day forecast appears below the current weather, showing daily min/max temperatures and conditions. Delivers planning value independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has searched for a city and sees current weather, **When** the forecast data loads, **Then** they see 3 forecast cards showing the next 3 days with date, weather condition, and min/max temperatures
2. **Given** the forecast is displayed, **When** the user looks at each forecast card, **Then** each card shows a distinct date (tomorrow, day after, etc.), condition icon, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature
3. **Given** the user searches for a new city, **When** the current weather updates, **Then** the 3-day forecast also updates to match the new location
4. **Given** forecast data is unavailable for a location, **When** the user searches for that location, **Then** they see current weather (if available) and a message like "Forecast unavailable for this location"

### User Story 3 - Experience Smooth Visual Interface (Priority: P3)

A user wants an aesthetically pleasing and responsive interface that makes checking weather enjoyable. The application features a gradient background, centered weather cards, and smooth animations when switching between cities.

**Why this priority**: Visual polish enhances user experience and engagement but is not core functionality. Users can get weather information without animations and gradients, making this a lower priority than data accuracy and availability.

**Independent Test**: With current weather and forecast features implemented (US1, US2), test by searching for multiple cities in sequence and observing smooth transitions, gradient backgrounds, and centered card layout. Delivers enhanced user experience independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application loads, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** they see a gradient background, a centered weather card with the search bar prominently displayed, and a temperature unit toggle control
2. **Given** weather data is displayed in Celsius, **When** the user clicks the temperature unit toggle, **Then** all temperatures update to Fahrenheit immediately
3. **Given** weather data is displayed in Fahrenheit, **When** the user clicks the temperature unit toggle, **Then** all temperatures update to Celsius immediately
4. **Given** the user searches for a city, **When** weather data loads, **Then** the weather card appears with a smooth fade-in or slide animation
5. **Given** weather data is displayed for one city, **When** the user searches for a different city, **Then** the old data transitions smoothly out and new data transitions smoothly in (no jarring jumps or flashes)
6. **Given** the user views the interface on different screen sizes, **When** they resize the window, **Then** the weather card remains centered and maintains readable proportions
7. **Given** forecast cards are displayed, **When** they appear on screen, **Then** each card has consistent styling with appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user enters an empty search query?
- How does the system handle very long city names or special characters in searches?
- What happens when the user enters coordinates in an invalid format (e.g., letters instead of numbers)?
- How does the system handle coordinates that are valid but point to the middle of an ocean or uninhabited area?
- What happens when the weather API rate limit is exceeded?
- How does the system behave when the user has no internet connection?
- What happens when the API returns incomplete data (e.g., missing humidity or wind speed)?
- How does the system handle multiple rapid searches in quick succession?
- What happens when the user's location has extreme weather values (e.g., very high/low temperatures)?
- How does the forecast behave near midnight when "tomorrow" changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept city names as search input and retrieve corresponding weather data
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) as search input

### Assumptions

- Weather data freshness: Current weather data will be fetched in real-time for each search (no caching beyond the current session)
- Default temperature unit: Celsius will be used as the default display unit
- Coordinate format: Latitude/longitude pairs in decimal degrees format (e.g., "40.7128,-74.0060")
- Forecast timing: 3-day forecast means the next 3 calendar days from the current date
- Animation duration: Transitions will complete within 300-500ms for responsive feel
- Search behavior: Each new search replaces the previous weather display (no history or comparison view)
- Error recovery: Users can retry searches immediately after errors without reload

### Key Entities

- **Weather Data**: Current weather information for a location, including temperature (numeric value with unit), weather condition (descriptive text like "Cloudy", "Rainy"), condition icon identifier, humidity (percentage), wind speed (numeric value with unit), and location name
- **Forecast Day**: Single day forecast entry containing date, weather condition description, condition icon identifier, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature
- **Location**: User-specified location identified either by city name (text string) or geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude pair)
- **Search Query**: User input representing either a city name or coordinate pair, subject to validation before processing
