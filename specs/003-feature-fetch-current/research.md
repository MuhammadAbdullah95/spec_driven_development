# Research Report: Weather Display Application

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: Weather Display Application
**Branch**: 003-feature-fetch-current

## Executive Summary

This research report resolves all technical clarifications identified in the implementation plan. The recommended technology stack is React (TypeScript) + Vite for frontend, Node.js Express for backend, with Vitest for testing. OpenWeather API will be integrated using coordinates-based queries with 10-minute caching to respect rate limits.

## 1. Technology Stack Selection

### Decision: React + TypeScript + Vite (Frontend), Node.js + Express (Backend)

**Rationale**:
- **React with Vite**: Largest ecosystem, mature tooling, and Vite provides instant hot module replacement with optimized production builds. Vite is the recommended approach for new React projects in 2025 (Create React App is officially sunset as of February 2025).
- **TypeScript**: Over 70% of new React projects use TypeScript. For a weather app with API data structures, temperature units, and state management, TypeScript's type safety catches bugs early and improves maintainability.
- **Node.js + Express**: Achieves required performance (<2s API response) while keeping the stack unified as JavaScript/TypeScript throughout. Express provides excellent middleware ecosystem for rate limiting, caching, and simple proxy implementation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Svelte**: Superior raw performance (1.6kb vs 40kb bundles), but smaller ecosystem and less familiar for most developers.
- **Vue**: Good balance of performance and simplicity, but React's ecosystem is more comprehensive for this use case.
- **Go Fiber (Backend)**: Fastest performance with goroutines, but introduces language complexity and splits the stack.
- **FastAPI (Python Backend)**: 3-5x slower than Express in benchmarks, adds deployment complexity.

**Performance Expectations**:
- API response: <2s easily achievable
- Cached data: 1.6ms (node-cache benchmarks) vs 350ms for API calls
- UI transitions: CSS transitions handle 300-500ms requirements
- Unit toggle: <100ms with React state updates

## 2. Animation Implementation Strategy

### Decision: CSS Transitions + Framer Motion (selective)

**Rationale**:
- **CSS Transitions** for core 300-500ms UI transitions, gradient backgrounds, fade-ins, and slides. Zero bundle size, hardware-accelerated, sufficient for smooth animations.
- **Framer Motion** (32kb gzipped) for React-specific declarative animations like weather card entrance animations and forecast card transitions.
- This hybrid approach keeps bundle size minimal while providing smooth, hardware-accelerated animations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **GSAP**: 23kb+ and overkill for this application's animation requirements.
- **Pure CSS**: Could handle everything, but Framer Motion provides better React integration for component-level animations.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use CSS `transition` property for hover states, unit toggle updates
- Use Framer Motion's `<motion.div>` for card entrance/exit animations
- All animations hardware-accelerated via `transform` and `opacity` properties

## 3. State Management Approach

### Decision: React Context API + useState

**Rationale**:
- Application state is relatively simple: current weather data, forecast data, temperature unit preference (C/F), search query, loading states, error states.
- Context API is perfectly sufficient for this scope, avoiding Redux's unnecessary complexity.
- Use Context for temperature unit preference (persisted across searches, avoid prop drilling).
- Use useState for component-level state (loading, errors, search input).

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Redux**: Overkill with unnecessary complexity for this application's state management needs.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative, but unnecessary for current scope. Provides easy migration path if app grows.

**State Structure**:
```typescript
// Global Context
{
  temperatureUnit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit',
  setTemperatureUnit: (unit) => void
}

// Component-level State
{
  weatherData: WeatherData | null,
  forecastData: ForecastDay[],
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: string | null,
  searchQuery: string
}
```

## 4. OpenWeather API Integration

### Decision: Coordinates-based queries with 10-minute caching

**API Endpoints**:
1. **Current Weather (Coordinates)**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API_KEY}&units={metric|imperial}`
2. **3-Day Forecast**: One Call API 3.0: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API_KEY}&units={metric|imperial}`

**Rationale**:
- City name queries are deprecated (still available but no longer maintained). Coordinates provide accurate, consistent results.
- One Call API 3.0 provides current weather + 8-day forecast in a single request (extract first 3 days).
- Free tier provides 1,000 calls/day and 60 calls/minute, sufficient for small-scale application with caching.

**Authentication**:
- API key (APPID) included as query parameter: `&appid={API_KEY}`
- Store API key in environment variables (never commit to repository)
- API keys activate within 2 hours of registration

**Rate Limits (Free Tier)**:
- 60 API calls per minute
- 1,000 calls per day
- Data updates every 10 minutes
- **Strategy**: Cache responses for 10-15 minutes per location to stay well within limits

**Response Format** (Key Fields):
```json
{
  "weather": [
    {
      "main": "Clear",           // Weather condition
      "description": "clear sky", // Detailed description
      "icon": "01d"              // Icon code
    }
  ],
  "main": {
    "temp": 15.5,               // Current temperature
    "humidity": 72              // Humidity percentage
  },
  "wind": {
    "speed": 3.5                // Wind speed
  },
  "name": "London"              // Location name
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- **401 Unauthorized**: API key missing/invalid → Check environment variable
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid coordinates → Validate input format
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded → Serve cached data, retry after 10 minutes
- Missing fields: Weather phenomena not present at measurement time → Use default values

**Best Practices**:
- Minimum cache duration: 10 minutes (aligns with data update frequency)
- Timeout: 5-10 seconds for API requests
- Temperature units: `&units=metric` (Celsius) or `&units=imperial` (Fahrenheit)
- Weather icons: `https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/{icon_code}@2x.png`
- Use Geocoding API (free) to convert city names to coordinates

## 5. Testing Framework Selection

### Decision: Vitest (Unit/Integration), React Testing Library (Components), MSW (API Mocking)

**Frontend Testing**:
- **Vitest**: 10-20x faster than Jest, native Vite integration, out-of-the-box TypeScript support, 85-90% Jest API compatibility.
- **React Testing Library**: Focus on user behavior rather than implementation details.
- **Playwright** (optional for E2E): Superior browser support, parallel execution if end-to-end testing needed.

**Backend Testing**:
- **Vitest**: Same framework as frontend for unified testing approach.
- **Supertest**: Express endpoint testing.

**API Mocking**:
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: Industry standard for API mocking in 2025. Intercepts requests at network level, works seamlessly in both browser and Node.js environments.

**Rationale**:
- Vitest 3 (released January 2025) is the clear winner for new projects.
- 2-5x faster test execution, built-in UI dashboard, minimal setup.
- MSW provides single source of truth for network behavior across all testing contexts.

**Testing Strategies**:
- **Async Operations**: Use `waitFor` from React Testing Library, `async/await` for cleaner code.
- **Animations**: Detect via DOM event listeners (`animationend`, `transitionend`), visual regression testing with Vitest browser mode.
- **Error Paths**: Use `react-error-boundary` library, mock error responses with MSW, test API failures, network errors, validation errors.
- **Input Validation**: Test real-time validation, per-field rules, edge cases (empty, special characters, boundary values).

**Coverage Goals**:
- 80%+ coverage for business logic (validation, conversion, API integration)
- Lower coverage acceptable for UI components (focus on critical paths)

## 6. Input Validation Strategy

### Decision: Client-side + Server-side validation with sanitization

**City Name Validation**:
- Non-empty string check
- Trim whitespace
- Sanitize special characters (allow letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes)
- Length limits: 1-100 characters
- Convert to coordinates using Geocoding API before weather request

**Coordinate Validation**:
- Format: "latitude,longitude" (comma-separated)
- Latitude range: -90 to 90 (decimal degrees)
- Longitude range: -180 to 180 (decimal degrees)
- Parse as floating-point numbers
- Reject non-numeric input

**Validation Libraries**:
- **Zod** (recommended): TypeScript-first schema validation with excellent DX
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with built-in validation

**Error Messages**:
- Empty query: "Please enter a city name or coordinates"
- Invalid city: "City not found. Please check the spelling and try again"
- Invalid coordinates: "Invalid coordinates. Use format: latitude,longitude (e.g., 40.7128,-74.0060)"
- Coordinates out of range: "Coordinates must be between -90 to 90 (latitude) and -180 to 180 (longitude)"

## 7. Error Handling Patterns

### Decision: User-friendly error messages with graceful degradation

**Error Categories**:

1. **Input Validation Errors** (Client-side)
   - Display inline error messages near search input
   - Prevent API call until input is valid
   - Examples: "Please enter a city name", "Invalid coordinate format"

2. **API Errors** (Server-side)
   - 401/403: "Unable to connect to weather service. Please try again later"
   - 404: "Location not found. Please check your input and try again"
   - 429: "Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again"
   - 500/502: "Weather service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment"

3. **Network Errors**
   - Timeout (>10s): "Request timed out. Please check your internet connection"
   - No connection: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection"
   - Serve cached data if available: "Showing cached weather data (updated X minutes ago)"

4. **Incomplete API Data**
   - Missing fields: Use default values (e.g., "N/A" for missing humidity)
   - Log missing fields for debugging
   - Display available data without breaking UI

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use Error Boundaries (react-error-boundary) for render-time errors
- Try-catch blocks for async API calls
- Centralized error handler in API service layer
- Toast notifications or inline error display (non-blocking)
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors

**Security**:
- Never expose API keys in error messages
- Never display raw API error messages to users
- Never expose stack traces in production

---

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Vercel (Frontend + Backend API Routes)

**Rationale**:
- Zero-config deployment for Vite + React
- Serverless functions for Express backend (API routes)
- Built-in HTTPS, CDN, automatic deployments from Git
- Generous free tier: 100GB bandwidth, 125k function invocations
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Edge network for optimal performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Netlify**: Similar features, slight edge for static-first sites, Vercel better for dynamic APIs
- **AWS/GCP**: More complex setup, overkill for this application's scale

**Environment Configuration**:
- Development: `.env.local` (gitignored)
- Production: Vercel dashboard environment variables
- Required variables: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
