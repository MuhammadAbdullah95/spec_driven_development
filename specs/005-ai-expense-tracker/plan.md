# Implementation Plan: AI-Enhanced Personal Expense Tracker

**Feature ID**: `005-ai-expense-tracker` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-ai-expense-tracker/spec.md`

## Summary

Build an intelligent personal expense tracking web application that combines traditional CRUD operations with AI-powered features via Google's Gemini API. Core capabilities include natural language expense entry, receipt image OCR, conversational spending insights, AI budget suggestions, manual expense management, visual analytics dashboard (Recharts), dark mode, and CSV export/import. Single-user, mobile-first responsive design with local storage and offline support for non-AI features.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2022+ / TypeScript 5.x (for type safety with AI integrations)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- React 18.2+ with Tailwind CSS 3.x for UI
- Recharts 2.x for data visualization
- @google/generative-ai SDK for Gemini API (gemini-1.5-pro, vision)
- Vite 5.x for build tooling
- React Router 6.x for navigation

**AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-pro for NLP/chat, gemini-1.5-pro-vision for OCR)
**Storage**: Browser localStorage with structured JSON (Phase 1), optional IndexedDB/database (Phase 2)
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (AI features mocked in tests)
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+), mobile-first responsive
**Project Type**: Web (frontend-only single-page application for Phase 1)

**Performance Goals**:
- <10s natural language expense entry including AI parsing (SC-001)
- <3s AI chat response time 95% of time (SC-004)
- <2s dashboard chart rendering for 1 year data (SC-007)
- <300ms dark mode transition (SC-009)
- <5s CSV export/import for 1K expenses (SC-010)

**AI Accuracy Targets**:
- 95%+ amount extraction accuracy (SC-002)
- 80%+ category extraction accuracy (SC-002)
- 90%+ receipt OCR accuracy for clear receipts (SC-003)

**Constraints**:
- Internet required for AI features (offline: manual CRUD only)
- English-language receipts only (initial version)
- Single currency (USD default)
- 10K+ expense entries without degradation (SC-008)
- Gemini API rate limits handled gracefully
- User provides own API key (no billing in app)

**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, ~10K expense records, 7 priority user stories (4 AI-powered, 3 traditional)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: No constitution.md exists for this project, but we'll evaluate against standard software engineering principles:

### Principle: Modular & Maintainable Code
✅ **PASS** - Design will use:
- Separate modules for AI services (NLP, OCR, chat), storage, expense logic, analytics
- Clear abstraction layers: UI → Services → Storage
- AI features isolated with fallback to manual entry
- Single-responsibility principle throughout

### Principle: User Privacy & Data Security
✅ **PASS** - Requirements explicit:
- All expense data and receipts stored locally (FR-009, Assumption #11)
- Only anonymized data sent to Gemini (amounts, categories, dates - no PII)
- API key securely stored in environment/local storage (FR-052)
- No user authentication needed (local-only data)
- FR-056: Error logging without exposing sensitive data

### Principle: Graceful Degradation
✅ **PASS** - Requirements designed for resilience:
- FR-053: Core CRUD functions work offline when AI unavailable
- FR-014: AI parsing failures fall back to manual form
- FR-022: Partial receipt extraction allows manual field completion
- FR-052: Rate limit handling with user-friendly messages
- FR-051: All error states handled with clear user guidance

### Principle: Progressive Enhancement
✅ **PASS** - Features layered by priority:
- P1: Manual CRUD + Natural language entry (core value)
- P2: Receipt OCR + Chat insights + Analytics (enhanced experience)
- P3: Budget suggestions + Data portability (advanced features)
- AI features enhance but don't replace manual controls

### Principle: Testability
✅ **PASS** - Plan includes:
- Unit tests for expense logic, validators, formatters
- Integration tests with mocked Gemini API responses
- Component tests for UI interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical paths (expense entry, filtering)
- AI parsing accuracy benchmarked against test dataset

**Gate Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED - Proceed to Phase 0 research

**Structure Decision**: Frontend-only web application with AI service layer. No backend needed for Phase 1 since all data stored locally and AI integration is direct to Gemini API. Future Phase 2 could add backend for cloud sync, shared expenses, or proxy API calls for API key security.

**AI Service Isolation**: All AI features isolated in `services/ai/` directory with clear interfaces. Failures don't impact core CRUD functionality. Each AI service can be mocked/disabled independently for testing and offline support.

## Complexity Tracking

**Acceptable Complexity Increases**:

1. **AI Integration Complexity**:
   - Rationale: Core differentiator requiring Gemini SDK integration
   - Mitigation: Abstracted behind service interfaces, graceful degradation
   - Impact: +4 AI service modules, ~800 LOC

2. **State Management Complexity**:
   - Rationale: React Context needed for AI state, theme, expenses across components
   - Mitigation: Separate contexts by concern, custom hooks for access patterns
   - Impact: +3 contexts, +4 custom hooks, ~400 LOC

3. **Chart Library Integration**:
   - Rationale: Required for visual analytics (user story requirement)
   - Mitigation: Recharts is declarative, encapsulated in chart components
   - Impact: +3 chart components, ~300 LOC

**Unjustified Complexity (Avoid)**:
- ❌ Custom charting engine (use Recharts as specified)
- ❌ Custom state management library (React Context sufficient for single-user)
- ❌ Server-side rendering (not needed for local-first app)
- ❌ Custom AI model training (use Gemini API as specified)
- ❌ Complex build pipeline beyond Vite defaults

**Total Estimated LOC**: ~6,000 (2,500 components, 1,500 services, 800 AI integration, 1,200 tests)

## Phase 0 Next Steps

Research phase will resolve:
1. Gemini API SDK setup and authentication patterns
2. Natural language parsing prompt engineering strategies
3. Receipt OCR best practices (image preprocessing, confidence scoring)
4. Conversational AI context management patterns
5. Tailwind CSS + Recharts integration approach
6. localStorage schema design for 10K+ expenses
7. Dark mode implementation with Tailwind
8. CSV export/import format specification
9. Error handling patterns for AI service failures
10. Testing strategy for AI features (mocking, fixtures)

Output will be `research.md` with decisions, rationale, and alternatives considered.
