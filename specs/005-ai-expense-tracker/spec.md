# Feature Specification: AI-Enhanced Personal Expense Tracker

**Feature ID**: `005-ai-expense-tracker`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a personal expense tracker React app with Tailwind styling that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter expenses by category (Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Entertainment, Health, Other) and date range. Each expense has amount (positive decimal), date (not future), category, and optional description. Display expenses in sortable list with category icons. Show statistics dashboard with total spending, category breakdown bar chart, and daily spending line chart using Recharts. Integrate Gemini API (gemini-1.5-pro) for: 1) Natural language expense entry where users type 'spent 50 on pizza yesterday' and AI extracts structured data, 2) Receipt image upload using Gemini Vision to auto-extract merchant/amount/date, 3) Chat interface for spending insights queries like 'how much on food this week', 4) Proactive budget suggestions and spending pattern analysis. Include dark mode toggle, CSV export/import, search functionality, responsive mobile-first design, smooth animations, error handling, and empty states."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Natural Language Expense Entry (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to type expenses in natural language like "spent $50 on pizza yesterday" so I can record expenses quickly without filling out forms.

**Why this priority**: This is the killer feature that differentiates this app from basic trackers. Natural language entry dramatically reduces friction in expense recording, making users more likely to maintain consistent tracking habits.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering various natural language phrases and verifying the AI correctly extracts amount, category, date, and description. Delivers immediate value by making expense entry as easy as texting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to record an expense quickly, **When** I type "spent 50 on pizza yesterday" in the natural language input, **Then** the system extracts amount ($50), suggests category (Food), sets date (yesterday), and description (pizza)
2. **Given** the AI has extracted expense data, **When** I review the parsed fields, **Then** I can edit any field before confirming to handle incorrect extractions
3. **Given** I enter an ambiguous phrase like "50 for dinner last night", **When** the AI parses it, **Then** it makes intelligent guesses (Food category) and flags uncertainty for user review
4. **Given** I'm recording an expense, **When** the AI cannot parse my input, **Then** I see helpful examples and can fall back to manual form entry

---

### User Story 2 - Receipt Image Upload with AI Extraction (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to upload a photo of my receipt so the app automatically extracts the merchant name, amount, date, and suggests a category without manual typing.

**Why this priority**: Receipt scanning is a major time-saver for users who collect physical receipts. This feature prevents data entry errors from misreading receipts and speeds up expense logging significantly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading various receipt images and verifying accurate extraction of merchant, amount, date, and reasonable category suggestions. Delivers value by eliminating manual transcription.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a receipt photo, **When** I upload it via camera or file picker, **Then** the system uses Gemini Vision to extract merchant name, total amount, transaction date, and suggests category based on merchant type
2. **Given** the system has extracted receipt data, **When** I review the extracted fields, **Then** all fields are editable and I must confirm before saving the expense
3. **Given** I upload a blurry or partial receipt, **When** the AI cannot read all fields, **Then** it extracts what it can and marks missing/uncertain fields for manual entry
4. **Given** I want to keep receipt records, **When** I upload a receipt image, **Then** the system optionally stores the image linked to the expense for future reference

---

### User Story 3 - Conversational Spending Insights (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to ask questions about my spending in natural language like "How much did I spend on food this week?" so I can get instant insights without navigating through charts.

**Why this priority**: Conversational insights make financial data accessible to users who aren't comfortable with dashboards. This lowers the learning curve and makes the app feel intelligent and personalized.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking various spending-related questions and verifying accurate, context-aware responses with relevant data. Delivers value by providing instant answers to spending questions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to check my spending, **When** I type "how much on food this week" in the chat, **Then** the AI returns total food spending for current week with breakdown by day and percentage of total spending
2. **Given** I ask about spending trends, **When** I type "am I spending more this month than last", **Then** the AI compares monthly totals and highlights significant category changes
3. **Given** I want category insights, **When** I ask "what's my biggest expense category", **Then** the AI identifies the category with highest spending and provides relevant statistics
4. **Given** I ask a complex question like "show me my average weekly food spending over the last 2 months", **When** the AI processes it, **Then** it provides accurate calculations with visual charts if relevant

---

### User Story 4 - AI-Powered Budget Suggestions (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the app to analyze my spending patterns and proactively suggest realistic budgets so I can improve my financial habits without manual planning.

**Why this priority**: Budget suggestions provide proactive value but require sufficient historical data. This is aspirational intelligence that enhances the core tracking features but isn't essential for basic usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by recording expenses over time and verifying the AI generates reasonable budget recommendations based on historical patterns. Delivers value by turning passive tracking into active financial planning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have 3+ months of expense history, **When** the AI analyzes my patterns, **Then** it suggests category-specific budgets based on my average spending plus reasonable variance
2. **Given** the AI has suggested budgets, **When** I review them, **Then** I can accept, modify, or dismiss suggestions with explanations for why each budget is recommended
3. **Given** I've set AI-suggested budgets, **When** I approach or exceed a budget, **Then** the app alerts me proactively with spending pace insights
4. **Given** I consistently overspend in a category, **When** the AI detects this pattern, **Then** it suggests actionable tips to reduce spending in that category

---

### User Story 5 - Standard Expense Management (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add, edit, delete, filter, and search expenses through traditional UI controls so I have full control when AI features aren't suitable.

**Why this priority**: Traditional CRUD operations are foundational. AI features enhance but don't replace the need for manual control. Users must be able to manage their data directly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating, modifying, deleting, filtering, and searching expenses through standard forms and controls. Delivers value by providing reliable manual control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want manual control, **When** I click "Add Expense", **Then** I see a form with amount, category dropdown, date picker, and description field
2. **Given** I have recorded expenses, **When** I click edit on any expense, **Then** I can modify all fields and save changes
3. **Given** I want to remove an expense, **When** I click delete, **Then** I see a confirmation dialog before permanent deletion
4. **Given** I have many expenses, **When** I use filters (category, date range) or search (description text), **Then** the list updates instantly to show matching results
5. **Given** I'm viewing the expense list, **When** I click column headers (date, amount, category), **Then** the list sorts by that column in ascending/descending order

---

### User Story 6 - Visual Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see my spending visualized through bar charts, line charts, and category breakdowns so I can quickly understand my financial patterns.

**Why this priority**: Visual analytics transform raw data into actionable insights. While AI chat can answer questions, many users prefer visual dashboards for at-a-glance understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by recording diverse expenses and verifying charts accurately represent spending patterns across time periods and categories. Delivers value through visual pattern recognition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have recorded expenses, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see total spending with current week/month summaries
2. **Given** I want category insights, **When** I view the category breakdown chart, **Then** I see a bar chart showing spending per category with amounts and percentages
3. **Given** I want trend analysis, **When** I view the daily spending chart, **Then** I see a line chart showing spending over time with date range selector
4. **Given** I'm viewing charts, **When** I click a bar or data point, **Then** I can drill down to see individual expenses in that category/date

---

### User Story 7 - Data Portability & Theme Customization (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to export my data to CSV, import from CSV, and toggle dark mode so I have control over my data and comfortable viewing experience.

**Why this priority**: Data portability ensures user ownership and prevents vendor lock-in. Dark mode is quality-of-life enhancement. Both are valuable but not core to expense tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by exporting expenses to CSV, verifying format, importing into new instance, and toggling dark mode. Delivers value through data control and viewing comfort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to backup my data, **When** I click "Export to CSV", **Then** I download a CSV file with all expense fields (amount, category, date, description) in standard format
2. **Given** I have expenses in CSV format, **When** I import the file, **Then** the system validates and imports expenses, showing preview before confirming
3. **Given** I prefer dark themes, **When** I toggle dark mode, **Then** the entire app UI switches to dark color scheme with smooth transition
4. **Given** I've set dark mode, **When** I close and reopen the app, **Then** my theme preference persists

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user inputs natural language the AI cannot parse? (Resolved: Show parsing error with examples, fallback to manual form)
- How does receipt OCR handle non-English receipts or unusual formats? (Resolved: English-only receipts supported in initial version. Non-English receipts will fail OCR with clear error message directing user to manual entry. Multi-language support can be added in future iterations)
- What happens when user asks the AI a question about data that doesn't exist (e.g., "spending last year" with no data)? (Resolved: AI responds with explanatory message like "I don't have expense data for that time period" and suggests checking available data range)
- How does the app handle API failures or rate limits from Gemini?
- What happens when user uploads a very large receipt image (>10MB)?
- How does the system handle time zone changes for date-based queries?
- What happens when user tries to import a malformed CSV file?
- How are expenses displayed when user has thousands of entries?
- What happens when user exceeds Gemini API quota?
- How does the app work when offline (AI features unavailable)?
- What happens when user deletes a category that's referenced in chat history or budget suggestions?

## Assumptions

1. **Single-user application**: Each user has isolated local data store; no multi-user or sharing features
2. **Gemini API access**: User has valid Google AI Studio API key for gemini-1.5-pro and vision capabilities
3. **API costs**: User accepts that AI features incur API costs based on Gemini pricing; app does not handle billing
4. **Internet required for AI**: Natural language parsing, receipt OCR, chat insights, and budget suggestions require internet; offline mode provides manual CRUD only
5. **Currency**: Single currency (USD default, but extensible); no multi-currency or conversion
6. **Authentication**: No user login required since data is local (API key stored securely locally)
7. **Receipt storage**: Receipt images stored locally or in browser storage; no cloud backup
8. **Data backup**: User responsible for data backup (CSV export); no automatic cloud sync
9. **Date handling**: All dates use device local timezone; no timezone conversion
10. **AI limitations**: Users understand AI parsing may be imperfect and must review extractions before confirming
11. **Privacy**: All expense data and receipt images stay local; only anonymized data sent to Gemini (amounts, categories, dates - no PII)
12. **Platform**: Web application (browser-based) as primary target; mobile-first responsive design
13. **Budget period**: Budgets reset monthly by default; weekly/custom periods are future enhancement
14. **Chart library**: Recharts used for visualizations; no custom chart engine
15. **Image upload**: Browser-based upload only; no direct camera integration for web (mobile browsers support camera via file picker)
16. **Receipt language**: English-language receipts only in initial version; non-English receipts will be rejected with error message
