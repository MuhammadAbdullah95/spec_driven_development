# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Enhanced Personal Expense Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **Note**: Gemini API and Recharts mentioned as per user requirements, but specification focuses on WHAT not HOW
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **RESOLVED**: English-only receipt support chosen (Option A)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (except user-specified technologies)

## Validation Results

### Clarifications Resolved

**Q1: Multi-language Receipt Scanning** ✓ RESOLVED

**User Selected**: Option A - English-only receipts supported

**Implementation**:
- Receipt OCR will focus on English-language receipts
- Non-English receipts will be rejected with clear error message directing user to manual entry
- FR-023 added: "System MUST detect and reject non-English receipts with clear error message directing user to manual entry"
- Assumption #16 added: "Receipt language: English-language receipts only in initial version; non-English receipts will be rejected with error message"
- Edge case resolved: "English-only receipts supported in initial version. Non-English receipts will fail OCR with clear error message directing user to manual entry. Multi-language support can be added in future iterations"

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive with 56 functional requirements across 7 user stories
- User explicitly requested specific technologies (React, Tailwind, Recharts, Gemini API) so these are included while keeping focus on capabilities
- Strong focus on AI-powered features differentiation: NL entry, receipt OCR, conversational insights, budget suggestions
- Clear fallback strategies defined for AI feature failures
- All clarifications resolved - specification is ready for planning phase

## Specification Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All validation criteria passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specification validated and approved
2. **Ready for `/speckit.plan`** - Technical planning phase
3. **Ready for `/speckit.tasks`** - Implementation task generation
4. Consider creating data-model.md and architecture diagrams during planning
