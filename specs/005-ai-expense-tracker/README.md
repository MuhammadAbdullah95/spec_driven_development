- **Smart Budget Suggestions**: AI analyzes patterns and proactively recommends realistic budgets

### ðŸ’ª Core Features
- Full CRUD operations for expenses (add, edit, delete, search, filter)
- 7 predefined categories with icons: Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Entertainment, Health, Other
- Visual analytics dashboard with Recharts (bar charts, line charts)
- Dark mode toggle with smooth animations
- CSV export/import for data portability
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Offline functionality (manual CRUD when AI unavailable)

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
