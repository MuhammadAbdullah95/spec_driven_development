# Specification Quality Checklist: Blog Post Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for planning

**Issues Found**: None - all validation criteria met

**Resolutions Applied**:
1. ✅ Content quality: All items pass - spec is user-focused with no implementation details
2. ✅ All requirements complete and testable
3. ✅ Clarification resolved: Maximum tag limit set to 10 tags per post (user selected Option B)
4. ✅ Added FR-016 to enforce tag limit validation
5. ✅ Updated edge case to reflect 10 tag limit
6. ✅ All functional requirement numbering corrected (FR-001 through FR-036)

**Next Steps**:
- ✅ Specification is complete and validated
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan

## Clarification Resolution

### Question 1: Maximum Tag Limit Per Post - RESOLVED

**User Selection**: Option B - Limit to 10 tags per post

**Changes Applied**:
- Updated edge case: "What happens when an author tries to assign more than 10 tags to a single post?"
- Updated FR-012: "System MUST allow posts to have zero or multiple tags up to a maximum of 10 tags per post"
- Added FR-016: "System MUST reject attempts to add more than 10 tags to a post with a clear validation message"

## Notes

- Specification meets all quality standards
- User stories are well-prioritized and independently testable (P1-P4)
- 36 functional requirements cover all aspects of the feature
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Assumptions clearly document out-of-scope items
- Tag limit of 10 encourages focused categorization and prevents abuse
