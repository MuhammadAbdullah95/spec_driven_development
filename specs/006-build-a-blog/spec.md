# Feature Specification: Blog Post Management System

**Feature Branch**: `006-build-a-blog`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a blog post management application where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Each blog post has a title, content body, excerpt/summary, publication status (draft, published, archived), publication date, author information, and multiple tags for categorization. Users should be able to filter posts by status, tags, and author, search posts by title or content, sort posts by publication date or title, and retrieve paginated lists of posts. The application needs user authentication where authors can only edit or delete their own posts, but all published posts are publicly readable. Each post can have multiple tags, and tags can be reused across different posts. The system should track creation and modification timestamps for all posts and provide meaningful validation messages for all operations."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Public Post Reading (Priority: P1)

Readers can browse and read published blog posts without authentication. This includes viewing full post content, seeing author information, and filtering posts by tags to discover relevant content.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - making content accessible to readers. Without this, the blog has no purpose. This story delivers immediate value and can be demonstrated without requiring complex authentication flows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating sample published posts and verifying they appear in the public listing. A test reader should be able to view posts, see author details, and use basic filtering without any authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the blog, **When** they view the post listing, **Then** they see all published posts with titles, excerpts, author names, and publication dates
2. **Given** a visitor sees a post in the listing, **When** they click to view full details, **Then** they see the complete post content, full author information, publication date, and all associated tags
3. **Given** multiple posts exist with different tags, **When** a visitor filters by a specific tag, **Then** only posts with that tag are displayed
4. **Given** posts in different statuses exist (draft, published, archived), **When** an unauthenticated visitor views the listing, **Then** only published posts are visible
5. **Given** many posts exist, **When** a visitor views the listing, **Then** posts are paginated with clear navigation controls showing 20 posts per page

### User Story 2 - Author Post Management (Priority: P2)

Authenticated authors can create new blog posts, save them as drafts, publish them when ready, and manage their own content through editing or deletion. Authors maintain full control over their own posts while being restricted from modifying others' content.

**Why this priority**: After readers can view content, authors need the ability to create and manage it. This enables the content creation workflow that feeds the reading experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by registering an author account, creating posts in various states (draft, published), and verifying the author can edit/delete their own posts but cannot modify posts created by other authors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated author, **When** they create a new post with title, content, excerpt, and tags, **Then** the post is saved as a draft with a creation timestamp
2. **Given** an author has a draft post, **When** they set the status to "published" and save, **Then** the post becomes visible to all readers with the current timestamp as publication date
3. **Given** an author is viewing their own post, **When** they click edit, **Then** they can modify any field (title, content, excerpt, status, tags) and save changes with an updated modification timestamp
4. **Given** an author is viewing another author's post, **When** they attempt to access edit or delete functions, **Then** they receive an authorization error and cannot proceed
5. **Given** an author has a published post, **When** they delete it, **Then** the post is removed from all public listings immediately
6. **Given** an author creates a post, **When** any required field is missing or invalid, **Then** they receive specific validation messages indicating which fields need correction

---

### User Story 3 - Advanced Search and Discovery (Priority: P3)

Users can search blog posts by keyword (searching both titles and content), sort results by different criteria (publication date, title), and filter by multiple dimensions (status, tags, author) simultaneously to find exactly the content they need.

**Why this priority**: Once basic reading and authoring work, advanced discovery features improve the user experience but aren't critical for initial launch. These features scale better with larger content volumes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating diverse posts with varied content, tags, and authors, then verifying search returns relevant results, sorting orders results correctly, and multiple filters can be combined.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** posts with varying content, **When** a user searches for a keyword, **Then** all posts containing that keyword in either title or content are returned, ranked by relevance
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user changes the sort order to "publication date (newest first)", **Then** posts are reordered with most recent first
3. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user changes the sort order to "title (A-Z)", **Then** posts are reordered alphabetically by title
4. **Given** an authenticated author views the post listing, **When** they filter by status "draft", **Then** only their own draft posts are visible (drafts from other authors remain hidden)
5. **Given** posts from multiple authors with multiple tags, **When** a user filters by both a specific tag AND a specific author, **Then** only posts matching both criteria are displayed
6. **Given** search or filter results span multiple pages, **When** a user navigates between pages, **Then** their search/filter/sort settings are preserved

---

### User Story 4 - Post Archival and Lifecycle (Priority: P4)

Authors can archive published posts to remove them from active circulation while preserving the content. Archived posts are hidden from public listings but remain accessible via direct link for historical reference.

**Why this priority**: This is a content management convenience feature that becomes valuable over time as content ages. Not critical for initial launch but important for long-term content governance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by publishing a post, archiving it, and verifying it no longer appears in public listings but remains accessible if someone has the direct URL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an author has a published post, **When** they change its status to "archived", **Then** the post disappears from public listings but remains viewable via direct URL
2. **Given** an archived post, **When** a reader accesses it via direct link, **Then** they see the full content with a visual indicator that the post is archived
3. **Given** an author views their own post listing, **When** they filter to show archived posts, **Then** they see all their archived posts with the ability to restore them to published status

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an author tries to publish a post with an empty title or content body?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits when an author modifies a post in multiple browser tabs?
- What happens when searching for special characters or very long search terms?
- How does the system handle posts with extremely long content that might affect pagination?
- What happens when an author is deleted but they have existing published posts?
- How does the system handle duplicate tag names (case sensitivity, whitespace)?
- What happens when filtering by a tag that has been removed from all posts?
- How does pagination behave when posts are deleted or published while a user is browsing?
- What happens when an author tries to assign more than 10 tags to a single post?

### Key Entities

- **BlogPost**: Represents a single blog article with title (string, required, max 200 chars), content (text, required, min 10 chars), excerpt (string, optional, max 500 chars), publication status (enum: draft/published/archived), publication date (timestamp, auto-set on publish), creation timestamp (auto-set), modification timestamp (auto-updated), relationship to author, relationship to multiple tags

- **Author**: Represents a content creator with unique identifier, name (string, required), relationship to multiple posts they've created. Authors have authentication credentials for login but those are managed separately.

- **Tag**: Represents a content categorization label with unique name (string, normalized to lowercase with trimmed whitespace), relationship to multiple posts. Tags are shared resources that can be reused across posts.

- **Relationships**:
  - One Author creates many BlogPosts (one-to-many)
  - One BlogPost has many Tags, one Tag belongs to many BlogPosts (many-to-many)
  - Each BlogPost has exactly one Author (required foreign key)

## Assumptions

- Authentication mechanism exists (registration, login, session management) as a prerequisite; this spec focuses on authorization (what authenticated users can do)
- "Author information" means associating each post with the creating author's identity; profile management features are out of scope
- Rich text formatting in content body refers to common markdown or HTML-like formatting (bold, italic, links, lists) but not embedded media or complex widgets
- Post deletion is permanent; soft-delete or trash/restore functionality is not required
- Email notifications for post publication, comments, or other engagement features are out of scope
- Social sharing, like buttons, view counters are out of scope
- Multi-language support is not required; single language (English) assumed
- SEO optimization (meta tags, sitemap generation) is out of scope for this feature
- Collaborative editing (multiple authors on one post) is not supported; single author ownership only
- Content moderation workflows (review before publish) are not required; authors have direct publish capability
