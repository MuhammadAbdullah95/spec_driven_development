# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily Expense Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW:
- No technology stack mentioned (languages, frameworks, databases)
- User scenarios written in plain language
- Requirements focus on capabilities, not implementation
- Written for business stakeholders to understand

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and testable:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each FR is specific and verifiable (e.g., "FR-002: validate positive numbers with up to 2 decimal places")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (15 seconds, 2 seconds, 10,000 entries, etc.)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (user-facing outcomes, not system internals)
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format for all 3 user stories
- Edge cases comprehensively cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope boundaries clearly delineate In Scope vs Out of Scope
- Assumptions section documents 10 explicit assumptions about currency, authentication, platform, etc.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- 20 functional requirements each map to specific acceptance scenarios
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover all major flows
- 8 measurable success criteria provide clear success definition
- No implementation leakage detected (confirmed double-check of spec)

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Complete with no clarifications needed
- Technology-agnostic and stakeholder-friendly
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Well-scoped with explicit boundaries and assumptions

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional detail refinement desired (optional)
