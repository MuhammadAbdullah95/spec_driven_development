# Feature Specification: Daily Expense Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `004-a-web-or`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A web or desktop app that helps users track their daily expenses, categorize them, and view spending summaries."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: When a user deletes a category that has expenses, what should be the default behavior? → A: Show dialog forcing user to choose: reassign to another category OR mark as uncategorized (no default action)
- Q: What type of chart should be used for category distribution? → A: Both pie and bar charts - user can toggle between views
- Q: What is the maximum allowed expense amount? → A: No limit - accept any positive number user enters
- Q: Which day should be considered the start of the week? → A: Monday - ISO 8601 / European convention (week runs Monday-Sunday)
- Q: How should "Uncategorized" be implemented? → A: Null/empty state - expenses with no category are stored with null reference, shown separately in UI

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Record Daily Expense (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to quickly record an expense with amount, category, and optional description so I can maintain an accurate log of my spending without disrupting my day.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - without expense recording, there is no app. This is the foundational feature that enables all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding an expense entry (amount + category + description), verifying it appears in the expense list, and confirming it persists across app sessions. Delivers immediate value by creating a digital spending log.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is open, **When** I enter an expense amount, select a category, add an optional description, and submit, **Then** the expense appears in my expense list with the current date/time
2. **Given** I have recorded expenses, **When** I close and reopen the app, **Then** all previously recorded expenses are still visible
3. **Given** I am entering an expense, **When** I leave the amount field empty or enter invalid data, **Then** I see clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected
4. **Given** I have recorded an expense, **When** I realize I made a mistake, **Then** I can edit the expense details or delete it entirely

### User Story 2 - Categorize Expenses (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to assign categories to my expenses (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Shopping, Health) so I can organize my spending and understand where my money goes.

**Why this priority**: Categorization transforms raw data into meaningful insights. Without it, users just have a list of numbers. This enables pattern recognition and informed decision-making.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating expenses with different categories, verifying each expense displays its category, and confirming that the app supports both predefined and user-defined categories. Delivers value by organizing spending into meaningful groups.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app has predefined categories (Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Shopping, Health), **When** I create an expense, **Then** I can select from these categories
2. **Given** I want to track expenses not covered by predefined categories, **When** I create a new custom category, **Then** it appears in the category list for future expenses
3. **Given** I have created custom categories, **When** I no longer need a category, **Then** I can edit or delete it (with appropriate warnings if expenses exist in that category)
4. **Given** I have assigned categories to expenses, **When** I view my expense list, **Then** I can filter or sort by category to see grouped spending

### User Story 3 - View Spending Summaries (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to view summaries of my spending over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) broken down by category so I can identify spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.

**Why this priority**: This is the analytical layer that provides actionable insights. While valuable, users can still benefit from P1 and P2 without analytics - they can manually review their categorized expense list.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating expenses across different dates and categories, then verifying that summary views correctly aggregate totals by time period and category. Delivers value by revealing spending patterns and trends.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have recorded expenses over multiple days, **When** I view the summary dashboard, **Then** I see my total spending for today, this week, and this month
2. **Given** I have expenses across multiple categories, **When** I view the category breakdown, **Then** I see total spending per category with percentages of overall spending
3. **Given** I want to understand my spending trends, **When** I select a time period (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, custom date range), **Then** I see a visual summary showing: (a) category breakdown as pie chart or bar chart (togglable), (b) spending over time as line/bar chart
4. **Given** I am viewing a spending summary, **When** I click on a category or time period, **Then** I can drill down to see the individual expenses that make up that total

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to record an expense with a negative amount or zero? (Resolved: System rejects with validation error; only positive amounts allowed)
- How does the system handle very large expense amounts (e.g., $1,000,000+)? (Resolved: No upper limit - system accepts any positive number)
- What happens when a user deletes a category that has existing expenses assigned to it? (Resolved: User must choose to either reassign expenses to another category or mark as uncategorized via mandatory dialog)
- How does the app handle expenses recorded in different time zones (if the user travels)?
- What happens when the user tries to create duplicate category names?
- How does the system handle data corruption or storage errors?
- What happens when the user's device runs out of storage space?
- How are expenses displayed when the user has recorded thousands of entries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create expense entries with amount (numeric), category (optional - can be null), date/time (auto-populated with current, editable), and description (optional text)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that expense amounts are positive numbers (greater than zero) with up to 2 decimal places, with no upper limit
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist all expense data locally so it survives app restarts and device reboots
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide predefined expense categories: Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Shopping, Health
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create custom expense categories with unique names
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to edit existing expense entries (all fields: amount, category, date, description)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to delete expense entries with confirmation prompt
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to edit or delete custom categories
- **FR-009**: System MUST warn users before deleting categories that contain expenses, presenting a mandatory dialog with two options: (1) reassign all expenses to another existing category, or (2) mark all expenses as uncategorized (set category reference to null). User MUST choose one option before deletion proceeds; there is no default action
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a list of all recorded expenses sorted by date (most recent first) with visible amount, category, date, and description
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to filter expense list by category, including a filter option for uncategorized expenses (null category)
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to filter expense list by date range (custom start/end dates)
- **FR-013**: System MUST calculate and display total spending for: today, current week (Monday-Sunday per ISO 8601), current month
- **FR-014**: System MUST calculate and display spending breakdown by category showing total amount and percentage of overall spending, with uncategorized expenses shown separately as "Uncategorized"
- **FR-015**: System MUST support custom date range selection for summary views (start date to end date)
- **FR-016**: System MUST display spending summaries visually with: (1) category distribution shown as both pie chart and bar chart with user toggle, (2) spending over time shown as line or bar chart
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to drill down from summary views to see individual expenses that comprise aggregated totals
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully (e.g., "No expenses recorded yet" when list is empty)
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid inputs (negative amounts, empty required fields, duplicate category names)
- **FR-020**: System MUST support searching expenses by description text

### Key Entities

- **Expense**: Represents a single spending transaction with amount (decimal), category (optional reference, can be null for uncategorized), date/time (timestamp), description (text), and unique identifier. Core entity that all features revolve around.
- **Category**: Represents a spending classification with name (text) and type (predefined/custom). Each expense may reference zero or one category (null reference means uncategorized). Supports organizing and analyzing expenses by spending type.
- **Summary**: Calculated aggregate data showing total spending for time periods (daily/weekly/monthly) and breakdowns by category. Derived from Expense entities, not stored independently.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can record a new expense in under 15 seconds from opening the app
- **SC-002**: System maintains data integrity - 100% of recorded expenses persist across app sessions with no data loss
- **SC-003**: Users can view spending summaries for any time period within 2 seconds of selecting the date range
- **SC-004**: 90% of users successfully record their first expense without external help or documentation
- **SC-005**: Users can categorize and filter expenses with no more than 3 clicks/interactions
- **SC-006**: Spending summaries accurately reflect expense data with zero calculation errors
- **SC-007**: System handles at least 10,000 expense entries per user without performance degradation (list loading, filtering, summary generation under 3 seconds)
- **SC-008**: Visual charts/graphs render within 2 seconds for datasets up to 1 year of daily expenses

## Assumptions

1. **Single-user application**: Each user has their own isolated data store; no multi-user or sharing features required in initial version
2. **Currency**: Single currency per user (USD assumed by default, but extensible to other currencies in future)
3. **No authentication required**: Since data is stored locally and app is single-user, no login/registration needed in Phase 1
4. **Date handling**: All dates use device local time zone; no international time zone conversion needed. Week boundaries follow ISO 8601 standard (Monday start)
5. **Offline-first**: App functions entirely offline since data is stored locally (Phase 1 localStorage)
6. **Data export not required**: Initial version focuses on recording and viewing; export to CSV/PDF can be added later
7. **Budget tracking not included**: This is expense tracking only; budget setting/alerts are potential future enhancements
8. **Receipt scanning not included**: Manual entry only; OCR/photo upload are potential future enhancements
9. **Recurring expenses not required**: Each expense is manually entered; automatic recurring entry is a potential enhancement
10. **Platform target**: Web application (browser-based) is primary target, with desktop app support meaning it can run in desktop browser or be packaged as Electron/similar (no native mobile in Phase 1)
