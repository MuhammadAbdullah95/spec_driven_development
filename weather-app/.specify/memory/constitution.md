# Weather App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. External API Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The application MUST use an external weather API service (OpenWeather, WeatherAPI, or
equivalent) as the sole source of weather data. Direct data collection, scraping, or
local weather databases are prohibited.

**Rationale**: External APIs provide reliable, up-to-date weather data with proper
licensing and maintenance. This principle ensures legal compliance and data accuracy.

### II. Dual-Mode Weather Retrieval

The application MUST support both current weather conditions and multi-day forecasts
(minimum 3-day forecast). Both modes MUST be accessible through the same interface.

**Rationale**: Users require both immediate weather information and planning capability.
A unified interface ensures consistent user experience across both modes.

### III. Input Validation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All user inputs (city names, coordinates, location identifiers) MUST be validated
before API requests. Invalid inputs MUST be rejected with clear error messages before
external API calls are made.

**Validation requirements**:
- City names: Non-empty strings, sanitized for special characters
- Coordinates: Valid latitude (-90 to 90) and longitude (-180 to 180) ranges
- Location identifiers: Format verification per API specification

**Rationale**: Input validation prevents unnecessary API calls, reduces quota consumption,
improves security, and provides immediate user feedback.

### IV. Layered Architecture

The application MUST maintain separation of concerns across three distinct layers:
- **API Layer**: External service communication, request/response handling
- **Logic Layer**: Data transformation, business rules, validation, caching
- **UI Layer**: User interaction, input collection, output presentation

**Cross-layer rules**:
- UI Layer MUST NOT directly call external APIs
- API Layer MUST NOT contain business logic or formatting
- Each layer MUST have independently testable components

**Rationale**: Layered architecture enables independent testing, easier maintenance,
component reusability, and simplified debugging. Changes to one layer (e.g., switching
weather APIs) do not cascade through the entire system.

### V. Graceful Degradation

The application MUST provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios:
- API unavailability (network errors, service downtime)
- Invalid API responses (malformed data, missing fields)
- Rate limiting or quota exceeded
- Invalid user input

**Error message requirements**:
- Plain language (avoid technical jargon)
- Actionable guidance where possible
- No exposure of API keys, internal errors, or stack traces

**Rationale**: Graceful degradation maintains user trust during failures and provides
clear guidance for resolution. User-friendly messaging reduces support burden.

## Architecture Constraints

### API Integration Standards

- API credentials MUST be externalized (environment variables, config files)
- API calls MUST implement timeout mechanisms (recommended: 5-10 seconds)
- Response caching SHOULD be implemented to reduce redundant API calls
- Rate limiting MUST be respected per API provider terms of service

### Data Handling

- Weather data MUST be validated upon receipt from external APIs
- Data transformation MUST occur in the Logic Layer only
- Sensitive data (API keys, user location history) MUST NOT be logged

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements

- Each architectural layer MUST have unit tests
- Integration tests MUST verify API layer communication
- Input validation MUST have comprehensive test coverage (valid, invalid, edge cases)
- Error handling paths MUST be tested for all identified failure modes

### Code Quality

- Functions SHOULD follow single responsibility principle
- Error handling MUST be explicit (no silent failures)
- Code MUST include inline documentation for complex logic
- Dependencies MUST be minimized and justified

### User Experience

- Response time for cached data MUST be under 1 second
- Error messages MUST appear within 2 seconds of failure
- Interface MUST support both city name and coordinate inputs
- Output MUST include essential weather parameters (temperature, conditions, humidity, wind)

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed changes MUST be documented with rationale
2. Impact analysis MUST be performed on existing codebase
3. Version increment follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
4. All templates and dependent artifacts MUST be updated for consistency

### Compliance Verification

- All pull requests MUST verify adherence to Core Principles
- Architecture review required for changes affecting layer separation
- Security review required for changes to API credential handling
- Performance testing required for changes affecting response time standards

### Complexity Justification

Any deviation from these principles MUST be documented with:
- Specific technical constraint necessitating the deviation
- Alternative approaches considered and rejected
- Mitigation plan to minimize deviation scope
- Approval from project maintainers

### Version Control

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. In case of conflict
between this document and implementation code, this constitution takes precedence.
